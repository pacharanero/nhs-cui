### 1 INTRODUCTION


This document is Annex D to " _Abbreviations and Acronyms_ " and proposes a possible design
approach for handling free text input in NHS clinical applications. This approach conforms to
current practices within safety critical systems.

**Note**


This document does not present a fully researched proposal. The information is presented here as a
suggested starting point for research to prove its validity more fully.

#### **1.1 Design Suggestion**


The suggested design is that when a user enters free text into an NHS clinical application, the
application should:


 Alert the user to any unexpanded abbreviations and acronyms


 Avoid restrictions that could cause the user to circumvent the clinical application


 Warn other application users of any remaining unexpanded abbreviations and acronyms


This design would notify all users about any abbreviation and acronym ambiguities in free text input
and prompt them to take appropriate action.

#### **1.2 Design Details**


To conform to this design approach, clinical applications which provide free text input should:


 Alert a user to the presence of unexpanded abbreviations and acronyms in the text input

after he finishes entering the information but before storing the text.


 Offer potential expansions for unexpanded abbreviations and acronyms in a simple fashion.


 Insert expansions for abbreviations and acronyms into the text once the user selects the

correct term


 Avoid errors by not offering default expansions for abbreviations and acronyms, which the

user could select by accident.


 Preserve the flow of user input when offering expansions and alerts. For example, a

background task could check text on entry but only alert the user to ambiguities when he
stores the text or moves to the next input field.


 Prevent the storage of known dangerous acronyms or abbreviations. For more information,

see the Abbreviations and Acronyms feature area.


 Alert users to the presence of unexpanded abbreviations and acronyms. These alerts make

users aware of the risk and prompt them to make an informed decision about interpretation
of the unexpanded acronym.

#### **1.3 Patient Safety**


Unambiguous presentation of abbreviations and acronyms promotes patient safety by minimising
the probability of confusion between similar terms. The approach that this document suggests
significantly enhances patient safety by enabling clinical applications to:


 Display a warning when users enter text containing ambiguous or misleading abbreviations

or acronyms.


 Avoid display of ambiguous or misleading abbreviations and acronyms.


 Display a warning when reading text that ambiguous items are present. This warning helps

the user to avoid acting on an incorrect interpretation of the original author's intent, with
possible undesirable consequences for the patient.

### 2 SAMPLE VIEWS


The following figure shows an illustration of this design.


Figure 1: How Unexpanded Abbreviations and Acronyms May Be Handled


**Note**


Figure 1is only a simple illustration of the design principles; It is not intended to prescribe any particular
interaction. This design suggestion does not mandate the use of a text box or this highlighting style, nor
does it specify the interaction for selecting the correct expansion for an abbreviation or acronym.

### 3 ACCESSIBILITY


The detailed accessibility considerations for this guidance depend on the precise design adopted to
adhere to the guidance. However this design must address several issues:


 The interface that alerts the user to the presence of unexpanded terms and allows users to

select the next unexpanded term must allow use by screen reader users, and those who
prefer or require keyboard or other input devices rather than mouse input.


 The difference between non-dangerous and dangerous unexpanded terms must be

apparent to users that cannot distinguish colours.

### 4 RESEARCH


Free-form patient notes are one of the most common areas of medical record-keeping, and are
likely to become increasingly computerised over the coming years. This change requires free text
input handlers in clinical applications that can deal with abbreviations and acronyms.


The challenge of interpreting shorthand terms is particularly evident in handover scenarios in
hospitals. In these scenarios, misinterpretation of abbreviations or acronyms can endanger patient
safety.


V.Hoban {R1} makes the following observation:


"When handing over information between colleagues, the avoidance of jargon and explanation of
abbreviations is essential".


The Junior Doctor's Committee guidance on clinical handover for clinicians and managers {R2}
echoes this advice. Clinical applications need to address this potential hazard and should reduce
the possibility of misinterpretation.


Clinical applications should allow busy clinicians to use abbreviations during note-taking, while
preventing or mitigating the consequences that could result from the display of abbreviations and
acronyms which users can misinterpret. Research in safety critical systems by Professor James
Reason {R3} presents a useful approach to thinking about how such systems work with people in
those organisations with the best safety records. Professor Reason calls these "High Reliability
Organisations".


“High reliability organisations are the prime examples of the system approach. They anticipate the
worst and equip themselves to deal with it at all levels of the organisation. It is hard, even
unnatural, for individuals to remain chronically uneasy, so their organisational culture takes on a
profound significance. Individuals may forget to be afraid, but the culture of a high reliability
organisation provides them with both the reminders and the tools to help them remember."


"For these organisations, the pursuit of safety is not so much about preventing isolated failures,
either human or technical, as about making the system as robust as is practicable in the face of its
human and operational hazards. High reliability organisations are not immune to adverse events,
but they have learnt the knack of converting these occasional setbacks into enhanced resilience of
the system.”


This observation implies that computerised systems achieve the best safety results when they put
"reminders and tools" in place which aid the organisational culture in helping clinicians remember
when to be "afraid" at the right time.


Thomas Nolan extends this idea {R4} and states that:


"Although errors cannot be reduced to zero, the aim of the system should be to reduce to zero the
instances in which an error harms a patient. A safe system has procedures and attributes that
make errors visible to those working in the system so that they can be corrected before causing
harm."


This statement leads to the conclusion that safe handling of abbreviations and acronyms should
ensure that the application highlights potentially hazardous unexpanded items to the user. Even a
time pressured user should then be aware of any ambiguity and be able to view possible alternative
meanings.
