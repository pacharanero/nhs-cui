**Patient Safety Process**
The development lifecycle for this design guide includes an integrated patient / clinical safety risk assessment and management process.
Known patient safety incidents relevant to this design guidance area have been researched and reviewed as part of ongoing development. The resulting guidance points aim to support mitigation of these known patient safety risks. In addition, the developers of this design guide have undertaken a patient safety risk assessment to identify new risks that could potentially be introduced by the guidance points in this document. Any potential risks identified have been assessed and managed to support the ongoing clinical safety case for this design guide.
The Hazard Log records all the risks that have been identified during development and describes mitigatory actions that, in some cases, will need to be taken by users of this design guide. The Hazard Log is a live document that is updated as the design guide is developed and maintained. Until this design guide has received full Clinical Authority to Release (CATR) from the NHS Connecting for Health (CFH) Clinical Safety Group (CSG) – based on an approved Clinical Safety Case – there may be outstanding patient safety risks yet to be identified and mitigated.
Additionally, users implementing applications that follow this design guide’s guidelines (for example, healthcare system suppliers) are expected to undertake further clinical safety risk assessments of their specific systems within their specific context of use.
[Refer to www.cui.nhs.uk](https://emea.mail.microsoft.com/OWA/redir.aspx?C=2aab7991b0924c8f92c4e2824ab8a971&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cui.nhs.uk) for further information on the patient safety process and for the safety status and any relevant accompanying safety documentation for this design guide.
### 1 INTRODUCTION

This document provides the design guidance for time display. It describes the area of focus, provides guidance and recommendations, and explains the rationale behind the guidance and recommendations.

This document is intended for use by anyone whose role includes screen design, or the implementation or assessment of NHS clinical applications. This document can therefore be used as guidance for the specification of time display within the user interface of a clinical application.

Table 1 describes the changes made since the previous version of this guidance (Baseline version 3.0.0.0 dated 12-Oct-2007):

**Deleted** D+Tb-0019 to D+Tb-0025

Replaced by D+Tb-0033 and D+Tb-0034

**Modified** Clarification of definitions for in scope (section 1.2.1)

Context clarification and ‘Durations shorter than a second’ in out of scope (section 1.2.2)

Context clarification for illustrations (section 2)

D+Tb-0001 Added ‘only’

D+Tb-0018 Modified to show 60 as a whole number rather than 90

**Added** Patient Safety Process note

D+Tb-0032 Indicating use of 24-hour clock

D+Tb-0033 D+Tb-0034

Definition of labels for periods of time

Extra usage example for durations over 24-hours (section 2.3.2)

Table 1: Changes Since the Last Baseline Version

#### 1.1 Customer Need

The display of exact times, approximate times and durations within software applications has inherent risks of misinterpretation based on how these values are displayed. Currently, there is no specific time display standard within the NHS for clinical applications, implying that various systems across the NHS will implement different approaches to displaying time. Due to this inconsistency, risks to effective clinical care and to patient safety arise.

**Inconsistency across systems**

Currently, clinical systems used within the NHS in England, across all care settings, differ in the way time is displayed. For example, our review of clinical systems showed a mix of both 24-hour and 12-hour time display formats being used. Inherent within this is the risk that healthcare professionals moving between clinical systems made by different suppliers can misinterpret time, leading to patient safety incidents, as defined by the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA). This risk is particularly relevant to healthcare practitioners who trained outside of the UK, since they may well be used to different conventions.

**A balanced approach to patient safety**

There is a clear argument that unambiguous time display would reduce the potential for human error leading to patient safety incidents. The guidance provides evidence of clinical safety either through primary or secondary sources.

**An opportunity for change**

The CUI Programme provides an opportunity to agree appropriate guidance for the NHS in England. If this opportunity is not taken, system suppliers, who are already developing clinical systems under the National Programme for IT (NPfIT), will continue to deliver different time displays. The risk to patient safety will therefore persist.

#### 1.2 Scope

##### 1.2.1 In Scope

This document provides guidance and recommendations for the following types of time display:

- Exact time – the precise time of an event

- Approximate time (or “fuzzy time”) – the estimated time of an event if the exact time is

unknown

- Time duration – a period of time

The guidance also includes the display of date and time combinations.

##### 1.2.2 Out of Scope

This section defines areas that are not covered in this guidance. Although there may be specific risks associated with these areas that are not addressed in this guidance, it is likely that the principles in this guidance will extend to the display of time in many of the areas listed below.

The following subject areas have not been considered in the development of this guidance:

- **Time entry**  - Guidance on entering times is described in _Design Guide Entry – Date and_

_Time Input_ **{R1}**

- **Durations shorter than a second**  - The shortest period of time described in this document

is a second. Fractions of a second are not considered

- **Date display**  - This document only applies to the display of time. Guidance on displaying

dates is described in _Design Guide Entry – Date Display_ **{R2}**

- **Labels**  - In addition to the time format, an important factor for clarity is the display of

unambiguous and consistent labels for times

- **Synchronisation**  - Synchronising current time across NHS systems, applications,

desktops and hospital clocks is not considered to be an issue in this guidance

- **Display styles**  - Choice of display font size, background and foreground text colour will

affect the readability of time as it will with all other displayed text. This document does not address general rules for text display

- **Data storage**  - The guidance relates only to the display layer of a software application, and

does not prescribe the way in which time values should be stored. We assume that any clinical IT system is capable of transforming the stored time format into the displayed time format without error

**Note**

Listing an item as out of scope does not classify it as unimportant. Project time and resource constraints inevitably restrict what can be in scope for a particular release. It is possible that items out of scope for this release may be considered for a future release.

#### 1.3 Key Principles

The following key principles reflect the critical areas of guidance discussed within this document:

- Enable all time information to be represented explicitly and completely, eliminating the

occurrence of ambiguous times

- Reduce the possibility of misinterpreting the time as a date or other information display

- Maximise the readability of the time by the use of clear separators between time elements

- Support application scenarios where the user needs to enter and view an approximate time

or duration

- Promote consistency across NHS applications by providing a small set of valid formats

### 2 RECOMMENDATIONS AND GUIDANCE

**Important**

The visual representations used within this document to display the guidance are illustrative only. They are simplified in order to support understanding of the guidance points. Stylistic choices, such as colours, fonts or icons are not part of the guidance and unless otherwise specified are not mandatory requirements for compliance with the guidance in this document.

#### 2.1 Exact Time

This section provides guidance for the display of exact times. Exact times display both hours and minutes, but may optionally also display seconds.

Figure 1 illustrates the required display format of an exact time without seconds. The required format is HH:mm (this notation follows the.NET Framework Standard DateTime Format Strings specification).

Figure 1: Examples of the Recommended Time Display Format for NHS Clinical Applications

Figure 2 illustrates the guidance for displaying exact times with seconds. The required format is HH:mm:ss.

Figure 2: Examples of the Recommended Time Display Format for NHS Clinical Applications, Including Seconds

Time may be displayed alongside a date to indicate a combined date and time. For more details on the date display format, please refer to the document _Design Guide Entry – Date Display_ **{R2}** . The following scenario is an example where date and time may be displayed together.

_“The midwife or attending clinician updates the maternity record with the final labour details._
_They use a structured entry form to record the newborn date and time of birth as Wednesday_
_14 June 2006 at 10:20 in the morning.”_

In this scenario, after the user has entered the information, the date and time would be displayed in combination.

Figure 3 illustrates the guidance for displaying combined dates and times.

Figure 3: Examples of the Recommended Date and Time Display Format for NHS Clinical Applications

A pair of time displays may be used to express a time range, for example, the start and end times of an event. The elapsed time between them may be expressed as a time duration (see section 2.3).

Lack of a leading zero for values less than 10

Incorrect field separation makes these examples difficult to read

The main justification for use of the 24-hour clock is patient safety. The 24-hour clock is the standard notation used by most safety-critical industries, and there are clear benefits in sharing best practice between these industries. Moreover, evidence from the Patient Safety Assessment for date and time revealed a number of high risk issues associated with the use of the 12-hour clock, predominantly concerning the potential for confusion between noon and midnight and, more generally, the confusion that would arise were both notations to be supported. In addition, user research with clinicians and administrators found unanimous support for the 24-hour clock format over the 12-hour clock format.

Additionally, the guidance in this document aims to display times in a manner that:

- Is easily readable and unambiguous

- Clearly differentiates between hours, minutes and seconds

- Is consistent and concise (requiring fewer characters than the 12-hour clock)

During the creation of this guidance, the following standards were reviewed:

- The ISO 8601: 2004: Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange –

Representation of dates and times **{R3}**

- World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Date and Time Format **{R4}**

- UK Government Data Standards (GovTalk) **{R5}**

- The NHS Data Dictionary **{R6}** : Time standard for the display of times with seconds

included. The proposed guidance is compliant with the Extended Format of ISO 8601, which displays time as hh:mm:ss. The ‘hh’ refers to a zero padded hour between 00 and 59, ‘mm’ refers to a zero padded minute between 00 and 59, and ‘ss’ refers to a zeropadded second between 00 and 59. In this format, a time may appear as ’13:47:30’. The proposed guidance is also compliant with the NHS Data Dictionary, which uses the UK Government Data Standards specification for Time. It is also compliant with the W3C format, which in turn is derived from ISO 8601

#### 2.2 Approximate (or “Fuzzy”) Time

This section presents guidance for the display of approximate times. Approximate (or “fuzzy”) time may be used to indicate an approximation of an exact time. The following is a clinical example where this may occur:

_“A paramedic arrives at a patient’s home at four o’clock in the morning. As part of an acute_
_episode, the patient describes to the paramedic that he woke around two in the morning with_
_pain over his left kidney that lasted five minutes.”_

In this scenario, the user will enter the time ’02:00’ into the system and should have the opportunity to identify this time as an approximation. The time would be displayed as an approximate time.

Figure 4 illustrates the guidance for the display of approximate times.

#### 2.3 Time Duration

This section presents guidance for the display of time durations, that is, periods of time. The following is a clinical example where the display of time duration may occur:

_“During a consultation, a clinician uses a structured entry form to record the fact that his_
_patient is experiencing absence attacks that last for 30 seconds.”_

In this scenario, after the user has entered the information, the time displayed would be ‘30sec’.

Figure 5 illustrates how time durations will be displayed.

Figure 5: Examples of the Recommended Time Duration Display Format for NHS Clinical Applications

Figure 6 shows additional examples of time duration display, which combine hours, minutes and seconds.

Figure 6: Further Examples of the Recommended Time Duration Display Format for NHS Clinical Applications

A duration display may also represent years, months, weeks and days. To prevent ambiguity between months and minutes, and to improve readability, time units will be displayed in order of decreasing significance with zero-valued units omitted.

Durations may also be approximate, in which case the display of an approximate duration value should be preceded with the word ‘Approx’.

There are a number of contexts where specific display rules may apply (such as displaying a patient’s age), but the precise definition of these rules is beyond the scope of this document.

Figure 7 shows another example of time duration, which is 5 days and 50 minutes.

Figure 7: Further Example of the Recommended Time Duration Display Format for NHS Clinical Applications

##### 2.3.1 Guidance

D+Tb-0017 Display durations using years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds, as appropriate Mandatory

D+Tb-0018 Use whole numbers for time duration, for example, 1, 5, and 60. Do not use decimals or fractions, for example, 0.5, 1.5, 3/4

D+Tb-0033 Ensure that the following minimal set of duration unit abbreviations is supported: **y** for years, **m** for months, **w** for weeks, **d** for days, **hr** for hours, **min** for minutes and **sec** for seconds

D+Tb-0034 Allow the set of duration unit abbreviations to be extended appropriately, for example, ‘hrs’ as well as ‘hr’. Ensure that any additions are unique within the entire set

The lack of white space separators makes these examples difficult to read

The use of the same character to indicate months and minutes gives rise to ambiguity

The motivation behind this guidance is to present a standard approach for displaying time durations that is clear, simple and unambiguous. In addition, the guidance allows time durations to be displayed using an appropriate combination of units, for example, 1y 3m 5d, or 5hr 6min 45sec.

Duration values and their respective units are always displayed as pairs, with no intervening white space between the value and unit. This saves space by using fewer characters overall, and the visual grouping helps to reduce the likelihood of values being associated with an incorrect unit.

An alternative approach would be to separate the values and units with whitespace, which is the principle adopted by the guidance for Medications Management **{R7}** . The rationale for this approach is that some letters (such as ‘s’, ‘o’ and ‘i’) can be misread as numbers (such as ‘5’, ‘0’ and ‘1’), so white space separators are used to reduce the likelihood of misreading errors (such as interpreting ‘12hr’ as ‘121 hours’). However, the likelihood of such errors for time durations is significantly smaller than for medications, since:

- The vocabulary under consideration is much smaller since it consists of just seven duration

symbols

- The units are always displayed in a fixed (and familiar) order

- The number of digits used to represent durations is much easier to predict, since hours,

minutes and seconds will typically be in the range 0-59, days will be in the range 0-6, months will be in the range 0-11, and so on

For these reasons, the approach of removing whitespace between duration values and units is preferred.

The duration symbols themselves are chosen to be memorable and intuitive, and to minimise the likelihood of misinterpretation. This is particularly important for differentiating months and minutes, as this is the most likely source of confusion (since these units share a common initial letter).

The duration symbol for hours is ‘hr’ rather than ‘hrs’ as this can be used to denote both the singular (‘1hr’) as well as the plural (‘2hr’). Conversely, using ‘hrs’ as the symbol would allow all duration units smaller than a day to be three characters in length (that is, ‘hrs’, ‘min’ and ‘sec’). This would provide a clear contrast with the remaining symbols, which are all one character in length (‘d’, ‘w’, ‘m’, ‘y’). However, the use of a plural (‘hrs’) would be inconsistent with the other symbols and, for this reason, the adoption of ‘hr’ is the preferred approach.

Note that this guidance applies to English only; for other cultures different symbols would be appropriate.
