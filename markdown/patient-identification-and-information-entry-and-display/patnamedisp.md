### PATIENT SAFETY PROCESS


The development lifecycle for this design guide includes an integrated patient / clinical safety risk
assessment and management process.


Known patient safety incidents relevant to this design guidance area have been researched and
reviewed as part of ongoing development. The resulting guidance points aim to support mitigation
of these known patient safety risks. In addition, the developers of this design guide have
undertaken a patient safety risk assessment to identify new risks that could potentially be
introduced by the guidance points in this document. Any potential risks identified have been
assessed and managed to support the ongoing clinical safety case for this design guide.


The Hazard Log records all the risks that have been identified during development and describes
mitigatory actions that, in some cases, will need to be taken by users of this design guide. The
Hazard Log is a live document that is updated as the design guide is developed and maintained.
Until this design guide has received full Clinical Authority to Release (CATR) from the NHS
Connecting for Health (NHS CFH) Clinical Safety Group (CSG) – based on an approved Clinical
Safety Case – there may be outstanding patient safety risks yet to be identified and mitigated.


Additionally, users implementing applications that follow this design guide’s guidelines (for
example, healthcare system suppliers) are expected to undertake further clinical safety risk
assessments of their specific systems within their specific context of use.


[Refer to www.cui.nhs.uk](https://emea.mail.microsoft.com/OWA/redir.aspx?C=2aab7991b0924c8f92c4e2824ab8a971&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cui.nhs.uk) for further information on the patient safety process and for the safety
status and any relevant accompanying safety documentation for this design guide.

### 1 INTRODUCTION


This document describes the design guidance for the display and input of Patient Name data. It
describes the area of focus, provides guidance and recommendations, and explains the rationale
behind the guidance and recommendations.


This document is intended for the use of anyone whose role includes screen design,
implementation, or assessment of an NHS clinical application. This document can be used as
guidance for the:


 Specification of an input and display control for Patient Name data in a user interface (UI)


 Implementation of an input and display control for Patient Name data within an application


 Assessment of an input and display control for Patient Name data in an NHS clinical

application user interface


Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 show examples of Patient Name display, and the two formats that
can be used to accept user input.

#### **1.1 Customer Need**


This section explains why the guidance has been created.

##### **1.1.1 Overview**


Patient names are displayed in multiple places within a clinical application. One example is in a
patient banner where unambiguous Patient Name display enhances patient safety and application
usability by:


 Ensuring the display of the Patient Name in a consistent and clear manner that is easy to

read, and clearly distinguishes name elements


 Ensuring quick and accurate identification of the patient

##### **1.1.2 Eliminating Inconsistencies Across Systems**


Significant inconsistencies exist in the labelling, inputting, and display of people’s names across
various clinical applications. This can result in incorrect identification of patients, leading to safety
issues and, potentially, additional staff training. Reduction of inconsistency is therefore an important
goal in itself, and the primary aim of this guidance.

##### **1.1.3 Simplified User Interface Design and Development**


Having a consistent layout and set of values for the input and display of data items in clinical
systems makes the design and development of such systems safer, easier and quicker.

#### **1.2 Scope**


This section defines the scope of this guidance document.

##### **1.2.1 In Scope**


This guidance is applicable primarily to electronic user interfaces such as those displayed on
desktop and laptop computers. However, many of the principles can be applied to paper form
design should it be required. The following items are in scope:


 **Defining the valid values for Patient Name display and input**


 **Labelling of information, including:**


 Definition of the elements of a Patient Name


 Definition of the values for each element


 How items of information are to be labelled; this will cover the label text, positioning and
any elements of styling required to differentiate labels visually from data


 **Control layout and structure, in order to achieve:**


 Optimal visibility of the values


 Easy recognition of the values in the context of the wider clinical application


 Easy recognition of data type requested for input


 Reduction of invalid entries


 **Size of input fields**, **in order to:**


 Avoid wasting screen space


 Ensure optimal display of entire data items

##### **1.2.2 Out of Scope**


This section defines areas that are not covered in this guidance. Although there may be specific
risks associated with these areas that are not addressed in this guidance, it is likely that the
principles in this guidance will extend to the input and display of patient name in many of the areas
listed below.


The following items are out of scope:


 **Data storage**  - This guidance does not prescribe the format for storing data that is input or

displayed


 **Terms of use**  - This guidance does not define when an input field or display should be

presented within a system


 **Form design**  - This guidance does not prescribe the correct layout for a form, the

navigation around a form, or how these controls should be labelled

**Note**


Listing an item as out of scope does not classify it as unimportant. Project time and resource constraints
inevitably restrict what can be in scope for a particular release. It is possible that items out of scope for
this release may be considered for a future release.

#### **1.3 Dependencies and Assumptions**


Compliance with other guidance and standards is required as follows:


 The design of NHS clinical applications must conform to _Accessibility Checkpoints for NHS_

_Clinical Applications_ **{R1}** and _Accessibility for Clinical Applications_ **{R2}**


 Standards with regard to naming and identifying patients issued by the National Patient

Safety Agency (NPSA) ( _Right patient – right care_ _[1]_ and _Standardising wristbands improves_
_patient safety_ _[2]_ )


**Important**


The visual representations used within this document to display the guidance are illustrative only. Stylistic
choices are not part of this guidance and are therefore not mandatory requirements for compliance with
the guidance in this document.

#### **1.4 Key Principles**


The following key principles have shaped the guidance in this document:


 Display information according to existing standards


 Minimise opportunities for human error


 Display sufficient instructional information to support data quality


 Promote consistency across the mix of users, NHS clinical applications and care settings


 Support reliable and accurate identification of an individual patient record


 Minimise opportunities where patient-clinician relationships may be compromised through

ambiguity

### 2 RECOMMENDATIONS AND GUIDANCE


The guidance provided throughout this document is based upon a programme of user research,
including:


 A desk-based research project looking at a range of information entry Web pages and

clinical applications


 A Web-based survey of 41 respondents drawn from NHS clinicians and administrative staff,

Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), community pharmacists, and NHS Connecting for
Health (NHS CFH)


 A Patient Safety Assessment


**Important:**


 The visual representations used within this document to display the guidance are illustrative only.

They are simplified in order to support understanding of the guidance points. Stylistic choices, such as
colours, fonts or icons are not part of the guidance and unless otherwise specified are not mandatory
requirements for compliance with the guidance in this document.


 This document refers to the various Patient Name inputs using consistent descriptors (‘Family Name’,

‘Given Name’ and so on). This includes the labels used within the visual representations. However,
the wording of those labels is not Mandatory but only Recommended (see section 2.5.1). It is
recognised that, where applicable and appropriate for the clinical context, implementations may use
differently worded labels. An example of alternative descriptors is used within patient wristbands
where ‘Family Name’ is replaced with ‘Last Name’ and ‘Given Name’ with ‘First Name’.

#### **2.1 Patient Name Display**


This section provides guidance for the display of a Patient Name with enough information to
distinguish it for identification purposes. Figure 4 illustrates the correct format for displaying a
Patient Name (with minimum identification attributes).


Figure 4: Patient Name Display with Minimum Attributes for Identification

##### **2.1.1 Guidance**



NID-0001 The display must present the Family Name in all uppercase letters to clearly distinguish it
from the Given Name.


NID-0002 The display must separate the Family Name and Given Name using a comma to further
establish that the Family Name is being placed first.


NID-0003 The display must include parentheses around the Title to separate and distinguish it from the
other name elements.

NID-0004 The display must present the name elements strictly in the order shown. Mandatory



NID-0005 The display must present all data for each specified element (Family Name, Given Name and
Title) of the Patient Name in full. Avoid truncation of information where possible.



Mandatory



NID-0006 The display must separate the presentation of Given Name and Title by a single space. Mandatory


NID-0007 The display must present the Title element in title case, for example, Sir not SIR, Mr not MR. Mandatory



NID-0008 The display must present a single pair of parentheses around the Title element, for example,
(Mr).

HSCIC Controlled Document



NID-0009 The display must allow any free-text (up to 35 characters) to be presented in the Title
element.


NID-0010 The display must, in accordance with the UK Government Data Standards Catalogue
guidelines, omit a trailing full stop from the Title element (for example, ‘Mr’ not ‘Mr.’).


NID-0011 The display must allow the Family Name, Given Name and Title elements to present at least
the maximum field sizes given in the NHS Connecting for Health Personal Demographics
Service [3] (PDS) FS 10.00, Issue 1A, 18th January 2005 (CDT D 0222).


NID-0012 The display must allow for the Family Name and Given Name elements to consist of multiple
components. Components are constituent parts of the name element that combine with other
parts to form the element as a whole. For example, the components of the name
LIDMAN-SUN are LIDMAN and SUN and the components of Mary Jane are Mary and Jane.
Components have the following features:

 Family Name components must consist of UPPERCASE alphabetic characters only, for

example, SMITH.

 Multiple Family Name components must be separated by a hyphen or a single space, for

example, LIDMAN-SUN-DEWAR or EVANS WEST.

 Given Name components must display in title case, for example, Nadejda.

 Multiple Given Name components must be separated by a hyphen or a single space, for

example, Anne-Jorun, Nis Bank.


NID-0013 The display should allow word wrapping to occur in instances where the field length exceeds
the width allocated to it on the form. If word wrapping occurs, it should be applied only at the
end of a whole field element or at the end of a field element component, if it comprises
multiple parts (for example, Middle name(s) field).

####  Family Name Given Name (Title) James Oliver Jones (Sir)

Ito Shu (Mr)



This example does not distinguish the
Given Name from the Family Name or
provide a Title, making it difficult to
determine Given Name, Family Name
and correct form of address.


These examples do not separate the
Given Name from Family Name,
making it difficult to determine what the
Given and Family Names actually are.


These examples omit a Given Name
element. Without a Given Name,
identification is difficult.


These examples omit a Family Name
element. Without a Family Name,
identification is difficult.


These examples show all elements in
the same case making it difficult to
visually separate Given and Family
Name elements. The comma,
however, provides a visual cue that
Family Name appears first.


This example shows too many name
elements, which hinder rather than aid
clarity.


This example shows only a Given and
Family Name. It does not give enough
information for a Title to be assumed.


This example shows a lack of clarity. It
is unclear if the Given Name contains
two name components or if the second
component is actually the Title.


These examples are provided in all
uppercase, making them difficult to
read.

##### **2.1.4 Rationale**


This recommendation provides the following benefits:



 Conforms to the person Title display guidance and maximum field sizes given in the PDS

and the UK Government Data Standards Catalogue (GDSC).


 Conforms with the proposed National ID card, which uses the construct of Family Name

first, with Family Name provided in uppercase


 Ensures a consistent visual representation for Patient Name within the patient banner

across NHS clinical applications.


 Provides a clear and readable format.


 Identifies clearly and uniquely each of the name elements (Family Name, Given Name and

Title).


Page 6


Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre


HSCIC Controlled Document


 Promotes patient safety by enabling doctors, clinicians, health professionals and

non-clinical staff to read patients' names quickly and accurately.


The recommended layout for Patient Name provides the best format because it lends itself to
consistency and clarity, with a clear distinction between individual name elements. This increases
patient safety by minimising the potential for reading error and providing accurate confirmation of
the patient's identity.


The recommended layout achieves this through:


 Presentation of the Family Name in all uppercase to clearly distinguish it from the Given

Name.


 Separation of the Family Name and Given Name using a comma to further establish that

the Family Name is placed first.


 Inclusion of parentheses around the Title to separate and distinguish it from the other name

elements.


_**2.1.4.1**_ _**Accessibility**_


The recommended format for the Patient Name display should present no barriers to accessibility.


Consistent adherence to the Patient Name display format aids accessibility as it makes the name
elements (Family Name, Given Name and Title) uniquely identifiable and recognisable whenever
they are encountered; both individually, and as part of the entire name. It also makes the name
elements distinguishable from other elements. From an accessibility perspective, this means that
even when the name is accessed out of context (for example, by a screen reader), it will still be
easily recognisable as a name, and that each element of that name can easily be identified. Using
distinct name elements in this way also means that users with imperfect vision will still be able to
correctly identify them.


Screen reader software cannot pronounce highly variable items, such as names, accurately on all
occasions. This however should not present any interpretation problems, as each of the name
elements will be identifiable and recognisable by consistent use. If pronunciation by the screen
reader causes problems, the user can spell out the name, letter by letter, using features of the
screen reader software.


The Family Name element is presented in all uppercase letters. It is widely recognised that this
decreases reading speed for all users, but it can cause particular problems for people with reading
difficulties such as Dyslexia. Despite this, displaying the Family Name element in all uppercase is
unlikely to present any accessibility problems or reading issues, for the following reasons:


 The decrease in reading speed caused by all uppercase letters is due to a disruption of the

recognition of whole word pattern, which occurs naturally for familiar words when seen
using the mixed case representation. Since Family Names are highly variable and many are
unusual, they do not fall into the category of known and familiar words, and so will not be
affected.


 Difficulties with reading uppercase letters only occur when it is used extensively. The

Family Name element is usually relatively short.


As the Family Name is a vital element for patient identification, any slight reduction in reading
speed would actually be seen to confer an advantage. The clinician will be more likely to interpret
the name correctly, rather than make mistakes caused by false recognition.


_**2.1.4.2**_ _**Existing Standards**_


Existing standards for person name display are limited. Government standards focus primarily on
the structure of a name, but not on the visual display of the structure. As such, these have been of
limited use for defining recommendations.


Page 7

HSCIC Controlled Document


The following sources (as described in more detail below) provide recommendations in relation to
name display:


 NPSA standards for naming and identifying patients ( _Right patient – right care_ **{R3}** and

_Standardising wristbands improves patient safety_ **{R4}** ).


 NHS Data Model and Dictionary


 NHS Connecting for Health Personal Demographics Service (PDS)


 UK Government Data Standards (UK GDSC)


 NHS Connecting for Health


 NHS Message Implementation Manual (MIM)


 Various Public Sector organisations


 Academic research


**NPSA Standardising Wristbands Improves Patient Safety**


The Safer Practice Notice no.24, published 3 July 2007, sets out actions for the NHS when using
patient wristbands including the core identifiers required on wristbands. From 18 July 2008 the
patient name descriptors to be used on wristbands are as follows:


 **Last name**


 **First name**


**NHS Data Model and Dictionary**


The NHS Data Model and Dictionary provides a reference point for assured information standards
to support health care activities within the NHS in England. During the production of this guidance
references to field length and parameters were taken from the NHS Data Model and Dictionary,
and were correct at the time of writing.


**NHS Connecting for Health Personal Demographics Service (PDS)**


The Personal Demographics Service defines the data schema for patient demographic information
held by the NHS. This schema will be the basis for a single patient record for England.


The set of data values within the PDS schema defines a data storage standard for name elements
as follows:


 **Person Title** **(35 Characters)**  - Title in the recommendation


 **Person Given name** **(40 Characters)**  - Given name in the recommendation


 **Person Family name** **(40 Characters)**  - Family name in the recommendation


The Patient Name display recommendation is based on the data storage requirements defined for
PDS as these take priority over other contradictory standards, such as UK GDSC (below).


**UK Government Data Standards Catalogue (UK GDSC)**


The UK Government Data Standards Catalogue defines a data storage standard for name
elements as follows:


 **Person Title** **(35 Characters)**  - Title in the recommendation


 **Person Given name** **(35 Characters)**  - Given name in the recommendation.


 **Person Family name** **(35 Characters)**  - Family name in the recommendation


**Note**


The UK GDSC differs from PDS for Given name and Family name data storage requirements in that UK
GDSC are 5 characters shorter for these data elements. This difference in standards may pose a potential


Page 8

HSCIC Controlled Document


risk for patient safety. There might be a miscommunication between systems that use different standards
and there is a potential for truncation or loss of information.


The UK GDSC also specifies that while the full available range of generally recognised titles is
permitted, if any of these titles are used, the value must conform to the specified format, which is
an appropriate abbreviated form with no full stop.


**NHS Connecting for Health**


NHS Connecting for Health has assumed responsibility for the NHS Data Dictionary. The NHS
Data Dictionary definitions for person name data attributes (Person Title, Person Given name,
Person Family name) refer directly to the UK GDSC, fully endorsing the standards defined there.
The only exception is Person Title, which does not list ‘Miss’ as a generally recognised Title.


**NHS NPfIT Message Implementation Manual (MIM)**


The MIM definition of a person name is used to express either an unstructured name as string
content of the element, or a structured name as a set of **FAM**, **GIV**, **PFX** and **SFX** child elements.
Where:


 FAM = Person Family name


 GIV = Person Given name


 PFX = Person Title


 SFX = Person Suffix


**Public Sector Organisations**


Name identifiers exist within certain UK public sectors, for example, Passport, National ID card,
Driving Licence and Proof of Age ID. There is a lack of consistency across the display standard for
these identifiers; however, they all use uppercase letters for the Family name element. This is
therefore a common convention that supports our recommendations.


 The National ID card shows a person’s name as **‘FAMILY NAME Given name’**


 The Passport card shows a person’s name as **‘FAMILY NAME GIVEN NAME’** (displayed

on separate lines)


 The Driving Licence Card shows a person’s name as **‘FAMILY NAME GIVEN NAME**

**MIDDLE NAMES’** (with **FAMILY NAME** appearing first on a separate line)


 The Proof of ID card shows a person’s name as **‘GIVEN NAME FAMILY NAME’** (displayed

on separate lines)


Public sector organisations have many examples of name layouts for forms and lists. These do not
show consistency or definitive ‘common practice’. However, most telephone directories (online or
printed) and CRM databases list Family name first (see BT [®] directory services online [4] ).


**Academic Research**


There are some academic studies and written recommendations on the subject of reading patterns
and pattern recognition. In general, these studies conclude that there are benefits for consistent
representation of data in a recognised pattern, as this enhances familiarity and recognition of
component parts. The _Developing Quality Technical Information_ handbook by IBM [®] (2nd Edition)
**{R6}** is one such source.


Existing standards for person name display are limited, and no definitive ‘common practice’ or
consistency exists. The recommendation for Patient Name display across NHS clinical applications

is therefore based on usability research, readability principles and the need for consistency, clarity
and easy identification of the patient.


This recommendation was adopted on the basis of the following justifications:


 Promotion of patient safety by presenting the name in a clear and consistent format that

allows the clinician to quickly identify the patient


 Use of an easily readable format


 Provision of a clear distinction of the elements that are most important for identification and

formal communication, that is, Given name, Family name and Title

##### **2.1.5 Optional Data Fields**


This section gives the rationale behind the inclusion of the optional data fields.


**Note**


The optional data fields described in this section are not exclusive. It is acknowledged that from time to
time other Patient Name fields may be required. As such circumstances cannot be anticipated, this
document provides no specific guidelines. It is up to the applications developer concerned to design an
appropriate solution, ensuring that there is no compromise of patient safety.


**Preferred Name (Requested Name)**


The NHS PDS FS 10.00 and the UK Government Data Standards Catalogue (UK GDSC) include a
Person Requested Name as an element of the Person Name. The UK GDSC defines Person
Requested Name as “ _The name a person wishes to use which is different from the values in Title,_
_Given name(s), Family name and Name Suffix fields_ ”. This would include, for example, a
preference to be addressed by middle name rather than Given Name.


**Nick Name (Alias or Known As)**


The NHS PDS FS 10.00 and the UK GDSC also include an Alias/Known As as an element of the
Person Name. Where the Preferred name is a name ‘type’ (for example, a desired alias consisting
of the minimum data set for a Name) it should be displayed as a full name display control without
needing a separate field in an existing data set. However, where the value is more a single
Nickname, it can be attached to an existing name control as an optional field, for example, ‘JohnnyBoy’.


**Suffixes**


In most cases, the suffix is not needed as it does not serve as a primary means of identifying or
addressing the patient and can quickly become too long, taking up valuable space in locations such
as the banner (for example, Rt Hon. John Doe, K.G., K.B.E., M.B., B.Chir). The incIusion of such
unnecessary data on screen only serves to distract from the important data there.


However, there are times when the use of a suffix is important:


 When relevant for patient identification (for example, ‘Jnr’ or ‘the third (III)’)


 When related to the correct, formal way to set out a name (for example, in a letter)


Although a minimal requirement, this demonstrates a need for the optional use of a suffix. The
presence of a check box to select a) “show on screen” or b) “use on letterhead” provides a user
with the ability to use where appropriate.


**Middle Names and Initials**


It is considered that middle name or initials are not often required as they:


 Do not serve as a primary means for identifying or addressing the patient


 May distract from quickly identifying the key name elements

Page 10

HSCIC Controlled Document


 May result in the Patient Name becoming overlong


However, they do need to be entered, where known, in the event that the primary identifiers are not
sufficient to produce a unique match.

#### **2.2 Patient Name Input Data Elements**


A Patient Name input control can consist of up to six constituent fields with labels; Title, Family
Name, Given Name, Middle name, Suffix, and Preferred name. The minimum data required to
make the name useful is considered to be Title, Family Name and Given Name. Middle name(s),
Preferred name and Suffix are considered to improve data quality, however they are not
mandatory.

##### **2.2.1 Title**

The Title field is designed as a drop-down combo-box (as shown in Figure 5). This design allows
the developer to assist the user in the input of a pre-defined set from a drop-down list, whilst also
allowing the flexibility of free-text input to augment the complex list of possible options.


Figure 5 displays a Patient Name input control in a default state (for example, an InForm design
with prompts and no data entered). Figure 6 displays the Title input element during a simple
interaction.


Figure 5: InForm Design (All Six Fields are Visible)


Figure 6: InForm Design with Title Drop-Down Clicked


The input box should allow a maximum of 35 characters in order to support the recognised data
entry requirements. The minimum width of the input box should be decided in accordance with the
maximum length of the presets available in the drop-down box but should never be less than four
characters (due to a standard requirement being to enter ‘Miss’).

##### **2.2.2 Family Name**


The Family Name input is in the form of a free-text entry box that accepts a maximum of 35
characters. Based upon average name length calculations, it is recommended that the width of the
box should never display less than eight characters and should have an optimal display length of
14 characters. At the optimal length, the box should be able to display over 99% of expected values
and even at the minimum length, it is expected that over 95% of names will be fully displayed. The
Family Name will be entered in the case chosen by the user (as they enter it), however, when the
entered value is displayed, it will all be in uppercase.


Figure 10 contains two examples of a user entering the Family Name in varieties of lowercase and
uppercase. Figure 11 demonstrates that the control will reformat the data consistently to
uppercase, when focus leaves the input field.

The Given Name input is in the form of a free-text entry box that accepts a maximum of 35
characters. Based upon average UK name length calculations, it is recommended that the box be
wide enough to display at least eight characters and should have an optimal width of 14 characters.
At this optimal width, the box would be able to fully display over 99% of expected values. At the
minimum width, it is expected that over 95% will be fully displayed. The Given Name will be entered

##### **2.2.4 Middle Name(s)**


The Middle name input is in the form of a free-text entry box that accepts a maximum of 100
characters. This length has been chosen due to the requirement for this input to accept multiple
entries. This maximum allows a significant number of entries (at least 18 of our standard
7-character Given Names) to be entered. The Middle name will be entered and displayed in the
case chosen by the user (as they enter it).

####  Input fields do not accept the

required input characters (for
example, 35 characters for
Family Name)

####  Input control does not control

all three fields for the minimum
data set (Title, Family Name,
and Given Name)

####  Title drop-down does not have

an option to encourage the
user to enter a different entry,
if a more applicable one is not
in the list


Table 12: Examples of Incorrect Implementation of Patient Name Guidance

##### **2.2.9 Rationale**



Not including all of the minimum data set in an input control
could compromise patient safety and data quality.


The user should be encouraged to give the best quality of
data available. They may not know that free-text entry is
possible if an alternative option (for example, ‘Other’) is not in
the list, and simply pick the most applicable one there.



![](patnamedisp_assets/patnamedisp.pdf-21-2.png)

![](patnamedisp_assets/patnamedisp.pdf-21-3.png)

![](patnamedisp_assets/patnamedisp.pdf-21-4.png)

The lengths of the input values for the Title, Family Name, Given Name and Suffix input fields have
been calculated based upon the rationale outlined in the Patient Name display requirements in
section 2.1.4. The length of the Middle name(s) input field is a suggestion based upon the
requirement for multiple name entries into this field. The length of the Preferred name is based
upon the requirement to display a single nickname rather than a full name comprised of multiple
elements.


The suggested lengths of the input boxes are based on the usability heuristic **{R5}** stating that each
“text field should be large enough to accommodate the majority of anticipated entries without
scrolling”. The expected values were assessed and applied to the default length size. The minimum
sizes took this requirement but also looked at the requirement to restrict the control footprint (space
used on a screen) due to factors outside of the control (for example, restricted space on a form).


Page 17

HSCIC Controlled Document

##### **2.2.10 Mandatory and Optional fields**


The minimum data set required to safely input a complete patient-safe name is as follows:


 Family Name


 Given Name


The following fields are optional:


 Title


 Middles name(s)


 Suffix


 Preferred name

#### **2.3  InForm Input Design**


The InForm layout is considered the most desirable layout from a patient safety and usability
perspective. It should therefore be the default choice for the ISV when developing a Patient Name
input control. Figure 12 displays a typical InForm style input control (with all six input fields):


Figure 12: InForm Design (All Six Fields Are Visible)

##### **2.3.1 Guidance**


NID-0047 InForm field controls must be aligned on the left edge of the input boxes. Mandatory



![](patnamedisp_assets/patnamedisp.pdf-22-0.png)

NID-0048 InForm field controls (where they exist) must be placed underneath each other in the
following order:

 Title

 Family Name

 Given Name

 Middle name(s)

 Suffix

 Known as

##### **2.3.2 Examples of Correct Usage**


####  All input fields are

left aligned
underneath each
other in the
specified order


Table 14: Correct Patient Name Input InForm Design Examples

##### **2.3.3 Examples of Incorrect Usage**



The InForm control is reported by users to be
the preferred design for readability, usability,
and familiarity purposes.



![](patnamedisp_assets/patnamedisp.pdf-23-1.png)


####  Fields are not left

aligned to each
other

####  Fields not in the

correct order


Table 15: Incorrect Patient Name Input InForm Design Examples

##### **2.3.4 Rationale**



Left aligning the controls aids readability for the
user. Not left aligning them makes the control
difficult to use and understand.


The order of the fields should reflect the
display and not contradict it. Errors will occur if
they are different.



![](patnamedisp_assets/patnamedisp.pdf-23-3.png)

![](patnamedisp_assets/patnamedisp.pdf-23-4.png)

This control allows the user to input a person name in its constituent parts. It is designed to
increase patient safety by encouraging data quality as much as is practicable without losing
flexibility.


Each individual part is referred to as a field. The minimum data set constitutes those fields that are
required to safely identify a patient. The remaining fields can optionally be present in the control (for
example, the developer can choose which fields they wish to use).


The InForm design is considered to be the most desirable for a majority of users due to familiarity
and readability. It should therefore be the first choice of a designer.

#### **2.4 InLine Input Design**


The InLine style design has the same fields as the InForm control but they are arranged
horizontally rather than vertically. Figure 13 displays a typical InLine style control (with all six input
fields included). Figure 14 displays how the control should wrap at whole elements, when
necessary, and that subsequent rows should align to the left edge of the first input field.


Figure 13: InLine Design (With All Six Fields Visible)


Figure 14: InLine Design Wrapped onto Two Lines (Withh All Six Fields Visible)

##### **2.4.1 Wrapping Behaviour**


The inline control should follow the wrapping behaviour illustrated in Figure 15. The basic principles
are:


 Wrap at whole fields


 Sentence style wrapping (for example, no alignment other than subsequent lines start at the

same point horizontally as the first item in the first line, therefore they are left aligned)

NID-0050 Correct presentation order is:

 Title

 Family Name

 Given Name

 Middle name(s)

 Suffix

 Known as



Mandatory



NID-0051 InLine design choice should only be used when InForm has been considered undesirable. Recommended

##### **2.4.3 Examples of Correct Usage**


####  Field input

controls only
wrapped at
dividing space

####  Fields in correct

order, to reinforce
display format


Table 17: Correct Patient Name Input Wrapping and Order Examples

##### **2.4.4 Examples of Incorrect Usage**



Fields must not be broken because this can
lead to errors in reading the values and
understanding the control.


The user will assume the input and display
formats will be identical and changing these
orders can lead to input error from the user.



![](patnamedisp_assets/patnamedisp.pdf-25-2.png)

![](patnamedisp_assets/patnamedisp.pdf-25-3.png)


####  Fields broken

across a field

####  Fields in wrong

order


Table 18: Incorrect Patient Name Input Wrapping and Order Examples



Fields must remain intact to assist the user in
understanding the control and the data.


The order of the control input should assist the
user in understanding how it will be displayed,
therefore not confusing the user as to the
order, for example, Family Name, then Given
Name.

##### **2.4.5 Rationale**


This control allows the user to input a person name in its constituent parts. It is designed to
increase patient safety by encouraging data quality as much as is practicable without losing
flexibility.


The InLine style should be seen as the second choice for an ISV, when the InForm design has
been considered undesirable for a particular form design due to factors such as space and
precedent.

#### **2.5 Instructional Text**


This section explains the instructional text assistance to be considered when constructing the input
controls.

##### **2.5.1 Field Labels**


Each field used to make up the name input control must have a label associated with it to inform
the user what is required of them. The location of these labels are related to the layout style of the
input control selected by the developer and are displayed in Figure 16 and Figure 17.


Figure 16: Label (Title) for a Field in the InForm Style


Figure 17: Label (Title) for a Field in the InLine Style


These are the recommended field labels:


 **Title:** "Title"


 **Family Name:** "Family Name"


 **Given Name:** "Given Name"


 **Middle name:** "Middle name(s)"


 **Suffix:** "Suffix"


 **Preferred name:** "Known as"

####  No label for the

different input
fields


Table 21: Incorrect Patient Name Input Control Label Formatting Examples


_**2.5.1.4**_ _**Rationale**_



Input controls with more than a single input
field require the use of labels to ensure the
user understands what is required.



![](patnamedisp_assets/patnamedisp.pdf-27-4.png)

Controls that consist of multiple input fields require clear labelling to assist the user in
understanding what input is required and where.


The guidelines follow the NPSA standards for naming and identifying patients ( _Right patient – right_
_care_ **{R3}** and _Standardising wristbands improves patient safety_ **{R4}** ).

##### **2.5.2 Prompts**

The controls could utilise a ‘prompt’ style design to give the clearest indication to the user of what is
expected in which input box, without increasing the screen footprint of the design. This is displayed
in Figure 18. The prompts should be visible until data is placed inside the control (either by the user
or a system). Some suggested default values are:


 **Title:** "e.g. Mr"


 **Family Name:** "e.g. SMITH"


 **Given Name:** "e.g. John"


 **Middle name(s):** "e.g. David James"


 **Suffix:** "e.g. Junior"


 **Known as:** "e.g. Johnny-Boy"


Figure 18: Example of Input Control with Prompts


_**2.5.2.1**_ _**Guidance**_


NID-0055 Each field in a name input control should have an associated prompt. Recommended


NID-0056 Prompts for Family Name should be capitalised. Recommended


NID-0057 All prompts except Family Name should have sentence style capitalisation. Recommended



NID-0058 Prompt values should be:

 **Title:** "e.g. Mr"

 **Family Name:** "e.g. SMITH"

 **Given Name:** "e.g. John"

 **Middle name(s):** "e.g. David James"

 **Suffix:** "e.g. Junior"

 **Known as:** "e.g. Johnny-Boy"



Recommended



NID-0059 Prompts should be lighter in weight and colour than the input text, and italicised. Recommended

Users may incorrectly think that an entry has
been made in the box.


Users are not informed as to the correct entry
format of Family Name.


Users are not informed as to the correct entry
format of Given Name.



The controls could use tooltips to give the user more verbose instructions than can be achieved in
a prompt. Suggested default values are:


 **Title:** "Select a Title from the list or simply type in a different Title" (illustrated in Figure 19)


 **Family Name:** "Enter the person’s Family Name (surname)"


 **Given Name:** "Enter the person’s Given Name (forename or Christian name)"


 **Middle name(s):** "Enter the person’s middle name(s)"
