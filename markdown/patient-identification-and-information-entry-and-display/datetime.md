**Patient Safety Process**


The development lifecycle for this design guide includes an integrated patient / clinical safety risk
assessment and management process.


Known patient safety incidents relevant to this design guidance area have been researched and
reviewed as part of ongoing development. The resulting guidance points aim to support mitigation
of these known patient safety risks. In addition, the developers of this design guide have
undertaken a patient safety risk assessment to identify new risks that could potentially be
introduced by the guidance points in this document. Any potential risks identified have been
assessed and managed to support the ongoing clinical safety case for this design guide.


The Hazard Log records all the risks that have been identified during development and describes
mitigatory actions that, in some cases, will need to be taken by users of this design guide. The
Hazard Log is a live document that is updated as the design guide is developed and maintained.
Until this design guide has received full Clinical Authority to Release (CATR) from the NHS
Connecting for Health (CFH) Clinical Safety Group (CSG) – based on an approved Clinical Safety
Case – there may be outstanding patient safety risks yet to be identified and mitigated.


Additionally, users implementing applications that follow this design guide’s guidelines (for
example, healthcare system suppliers) are expected to undertake further clinical safety risk
assessments of their specific systems within their specific context of use.


[Refer to www.cui.nhs.uk](https://emea.mail.microsoft.com/OWA/redir.aspx?C=2aab7991b0924c8f92c4e2824ab8a971&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cui.nhs.uk) for further information on the patient safety process and for the safety
status and any relevant accompanying safety documentation for this design guide.

provides guidance and recommendations, and explains the rationale behind the guidance and
recommendations.


This document is intended for use by anyone whose role includes screen design, or the
implementation or assessment of NHS clinical applications. This document can therefore be used
as guidance for the specification of entering date and times through the user interface of a clinical
application.

#### **1.1 Customer Need**


The entry of date and time information is a fundamental function within clinical and administrative
processes. It is vital that healthcare workers correctly enter dates relating to patient demographics,
clinical episodes and planned treatments, among others. Promoting patient safety is of primary
importance and depends upon the removal of ambiguity during date and time entry. Therefore, it is
vital that date and time input controls provide a clear mechanism for guiding users towards the
entry of an accurate value, while also assisting the user to disambiguate entries when necessary.
Examples of use include:


 Specific drug administration dates within a course of medication


 Identification of a patient using a date of birth


 Key appointment dates and times within a patient care plan


In almost all cases, errors in the entry of date and time information will have safety implications for
patients.


Modern user interfaces offer the user a variety of mechanisms for entering dates and times. These
range from constrained methods, such as drop-down lists providing a small set of allowable values,
to more flexible calendar and spin controls, and highly flexible free-text entry fields. Each method
exhibits strengths and weaknesses, and can be appropriate for specific purposes.


The objective of this document is to provide a consistent, safety-assured method of entering dates
and times. A precondition for this is compliance with the NHS Common User Interface standard for
Date Display **{R1}**, as the short format described in this document is used by the date input control.
Likewise, a further precondition is compliance with the NHS Common User Interface standard for
Time Display **{R2}**, as this format is used by the time input control. These standards must be used
in all cases where the NHS application displays dates or times that affect patient treatment and
identification. The entry of dates in the long date format is currently under review.

#### **1.2 Scope**

##### **1.2.1 In Scope**


This document provides guidance and recommendations for the entry of the following forms of date
and time input:


 Fully specified dates – A fully specified date comprises three elements: day of month,

month and year


 Fully specified times – A fully specified time comprises hours and minutes and (optionally)

seconds


 Partially specified dates (such as, year only, or month and year)


 Approximate dates and times (such as cases where the exact date or time is unknown)


 Arithmetic shortcuts (such as ‘+2d’ to mean ‘plus two days’)


 Date and time durations


This document also provides guidance and recommendations for the following methods of date and
time input:


 Input via free text fields


 Input via input controls (such as, a calendar picker for dates or a ‘spin’ control for times)


This document also provides guidance and recommendations for disambiguation of date entries.

##### **1.2.2 Out of Scope**


This section defines areas that are not covered in this guidance. Although there may be specific
risks associated with these areas that are not addressed in this guidance, it is likely that the
principles in this guidance will extend to the input of date and time in many of the areas listed
below.


The following subject areas are not covered within this document:


 **Date and time display**  - This document provides guidance for only the entry of date and

time. Guidance on displaying dates is described in _Design Guide Entry – Date Display_ **{R1}** .
Guidance on displaying times is described in _Design Guide Entry – Time Display_ **{R2}**


 **Default dates**  - This guidance only relates to the input of data by a user and not to any

default dates assumed by developers


 **Durations shorter than a second**  - The shortest period of time described in this

document is a second. Fractions of a second are not considered


 **Synchronisation**  - Synchronising current time across NHS systems, applications,

desktops and hospital clocks is not considered to be an issue in this guidance


 **Display styles**  - Choice of display font size, background and foreground text colour will

affect the readability, as it will with all other displayed text. This document does not address
general rules for text display


 **Data storage**  - The guidance relates only to the display layer of a software application, and

does not prescribe the way in which time values should be stored. We assume that any
clinical IT system is capable of transforming the stored time format into the displayed time
format without error

**Note**


Listing an item as out of scope does not classify it as unimportant. Project time and resource constraints
inevitably restrict what can be in scope for a particular release. It is possible that items out of scope for
this release may be considered for a future release.

#### **1.3 Key Principles**


The following key principles reflect the critical areas of guidance discussed within this document:


 Enable dates and times to be entered in a range of formats and using a variety of input

methods, including arithmetic shortcuts


 Support application scenarios where the user needs to enter approximate dates or times


 Provide the ability to enter either fully specified or partially specified dates


 Simplify the entry of times by standardising on the 24-hour clock


 Reduce the likelihood of errors by providing disambiguation of the input, where appropriate


 A system will be built using a calendar database that recognises the change between

Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and British Summer Time (BST) where appropriate.

### 2 RECOMMENDATIONS AND GUIDANCE


**Important**


The visual representations used within this document to display the guidance are illustrative only. They
are simplified in order to support understanding of the guidance points. Stylistic choices, such as colours,
fonts or icons are not part of the guidance and unless otherwise specified are not mandatory requirements
for compliance with the guidance in this document.

#### **2.1 Free Text Date Input**


This section provides guidance for the entry of dates, including fully specified dates, partially
specified dates, and dates which have been entered using arithmetic shortcuts. The entry of
partially specified dates will not be appropriate for every situation. Therefore, the designers of the
host Independent Software Vendor (ISV) application will need to decide what types of dates are
allowed for a given situation, based on the specific clinical context.


The basic date input control, as illustrated in Figure 1, comprises:


 A free text input area


 A calendar control


 An icon to access the calendar control


 A default input dependent on the context in which the control is used


 A facility to disambiguate the date entered (see section 2.6)


The control should appear with a short and descriptive label wherever it is used.


Figure 1: Example of the Recommended Date Input Control for NHS Clinical Applications (Free Text)


The date input control should provide instructions on how the control is used, for example, via the
use of tooltips, as illustrated in Figure 2. The choice of control and the instructional text will depend
on the clinical context in which the control is used.


Figure 2: Example of Instructions for Entry of Dates for NHS Clinical Applications


The date input control can be used to enter fully specified dates, partially specified dates, and
arithmetic shortcuts, as illustrated in Figure 3.


Figure 3: Examples of Different Date Entries


The use of arithmetic shortcuts allows the user to enter dates that are calculated relative to the
existing value. For example, ‘+3m’ for three months later, or ‘-2d’ for two days earlier.


The free text date input control must allow the individual date elements to be edited. For example,
the user must be able to edit each element in the date 05-May-2006, as illustrated in Figure 4.

D+Tc-0046 Within the date input control, allow users to select the entire value to facilitate rapid editing or entry
of arithmetic shortcuts relating to date (only)


D+Tc-0007 Allow users to enter arithmetic shortcuts, such as, ‘+3m’ for three months later or ‘-2d’ for two days
earlier. The relevant operators are:

 ‘+’ for later dates (this is optional, as whole numbers should be treated as positive by

default)
 ‘-’ for earlier dates
 ‘d’ for days
 ‘w’ for weeks
 ‘m’ for months
 ‘y’ for years

D+Tc-0042 When displaying a default input within the free text input box, provide the user with an example of
date with either a non-specific value (such as the input mask) or a date appropriate to the clinical
context (for example, ‘today’s date’)

Table 4: Incorrect Examples of Date Using Free Text Input

##### **2.1.4 Rationale**


The rationale behind providing access to instructional text is to enable the user to see examples of
the different date types that can be entered and thereby rapidly familiarise themselves with the
range of functionality that the control supports.


Displaying a default input within the free text input area of the field provides the user with a further
example for the entry of dates. The default should either be a non-specific value, such as the input
mask, or be set to a date appropriate to the clinical context. For example, ‘today’s date’ may be
used for a date input field to record the date of an examination.


When the focus is placed within a date field, the entire value should be selected to facilitate rapid
editing or entry of arithmetic shortcuts. However, this should not preclude the editing of individual
date elements either via mouse selection or keyboard input.

#### **2.2 Calendar Date Input**


This section provides guidance for the input of fully specified dates and partially specified dates
using the calendar control. The calendar control, illustrated in Figure 5, is opened by clicking on the
calendar icon illustrated in Figure 1.


Figure 5: Example of the Recommended Date Input Control for NHS Clinical Applications (Calendar Control)


Fully specified dates can be entered via the calendar control by selecting the appropriate date from
the calendar, as illustrated in Figure 6. Once a date has been selected, the date is displayed in the
free text area of the control.

Figure 6: Example of Entering Fully Specified Dates Using the Calendar Control for NHS Clinical Applications


A partially specified date can be entered using the calendar control by clicking either the month or
the year, as illustrated in Figure 7. When entering a partially specified date, the corresponding
value is displayed in the free text area of the control.

be carried out by month. The
calendar must provide the ability to
independently navigate both
forwards and backwards in months
and years


Table 7: Incorrect Examples of Date Using Calendar Input

##### **2.2.4 Rationale**


The rationale for this guidance is based on an extensive analysis of existing calendar controls, from
which many of the ‘best practice’ features have been derived, such as:


 Scrolling month selection


 Day of week labelling


 A short cut for selecting today’s date


 Display of the current month in title case and the year displayed in the form YYYY


 A visual indication of the current date


In addition, the design of this calendar control also allows the user to enter both fully and partially
specified dates, and to independently manipulate both months and years. Clicking on a ‘forward’ or
‘backward’ icon will move the calendar either forward or backward by the appropriate amount (that
is, one month or one year). This allows much greater flexibility than forcing the user to navigate on
a month by month basis (see Table 7). In addition, the calendar control is specifically designed to
indicate to the user the full range of input available. This includes styling to expose the interactivity
of the header elements (which allow entry of partially specified dates) and also the behaviour of the
forward and backward icons.

#### **2.3 Time Input**


This section provides guidance for the input of fully specified time, and time entered using an
arithmetic shortcut. In addition, it describes how the entry of a time can be marked as approximate
(for example, in cases where the exact time is unknown). Evidently, the entry of an approximate
time will not be appropriate for every situation, as this will depend on the specific clinical context.


The basic time input control, as illustrated in Figure 8, comprises (from left to right):


 An input area


 A default input dependent on the context in which the control is used


 A ‘spin’ control


 A tick box to indicate if the time is approximate (where supported by the specific clinical

application)


Page 8

![](datetime_assets/datetime.pdf-12-1.png)
HSCIC Controlled Document


The control should appear with a short and descriptive label wherever it is used.


Figure 8: Example of the Recommended Time Input Control for NHS Clinical Applications


The time input control should provide instructions on how the control is used, for example, via the
use of tooltips, as illustrated in Figure 9. The choice of control and the instructional text will depend
on the clinical context in which the control is used.


Figure 9: Example of Instructions for Entry of Time for NHS Clinical Applications


The time input control can be used to enter fully specified times, approximate times and arithmetic
shortcuts, as illustrated in Figure 10. In addition, the ‘seconds’ element of time can be entered if
required. The inclusion of seconds is at the discretion of the host ISV application.


Figure 10: Examples of Different Time Entries


The use of arithmetic shortcuts allows the user to enter times that are calculated relative to an
existing value. For example, ‘+3h’ for three hours later, or ‘-2m’ for two minutes earlier. In addition,
the control must allow for the entry of ‘Unknown’, as illustrated in Figure 11.


Figure 11: Example of the Entry of an Unknown Time


The time input control must allow for individual editing of the time elements entered into the control.
For example, the user will be able to edit each element in the time 23:35 or 23:35:42, as illustrated
in Figure 12.

The rationale behind providing access to instructional text is to enable the user to see examples of
the different time types that can be entered and thereby rapidly familiarise themselves with the
range of functionality that the control supports.


Likewise, displaying a default within the input area provides the user with a further example for time
entry. The default should either be a non-specific value, such as the input mask, or be set to a time
appropriate to the clinical context. When the focus is placed within a time field, the entire value

should be selected to facilitate rapid editing or entry of arithmetic shortcuts. However, this should
not preclude the editing of individual time elements either via mouse selection or keyboard input.

#### **2.4 Spin Control Time Input**


This section provides guidance for the input of time using a spin control.


Times can be entered using a spin control, as illustrated in Figure 13 and Figure 14. If the focus of
the control is on the whole value (hours and minutes), or no time unit is selected, the time will
increase/decrease by the least significant time unit when the user clicks the relevant ‘up’ and
‘down’ spin control buttons, as illustrated in Figure 13.


Figure 13: Examples of Spin Control


If an individual element of the time is selected, the increase/decrease will be applied to that specific
time element. For example, if minutes are in the focus, the change will be applied to that element,
as illustrated in Figure 14.

![](datetime_assets/datetime.pdf-15-4.png)
HSCIC Controlled Document

##### **2.4.4 Rationale**


The rationale for this guidance is based on an extensive analysis of relevant Windows user
experience guidelines and existing time input controls. This analysis found the spin control to be
preferable to alternatives such as using drop-down lists for each time element. The design of the
spin control allows the user to easily adjust a time value, either forward or backward, by the
appropriate amount (that is, by the hour or by the minute). As such, it is ideally suited to time input,
as it allows users to make small, incremental changes to numeric values without moving their
hands from the mouse.

#### **2.5 Time Duration Input**


This section presents guidance for the input of time durations.


The basic duration input control is illustrated in Figure 15. The control should appear with a short
and descriptive label wherever it is used. The duration input control should provide instructions on
how the control is used, for example, via the use of tooltips.


Figure 15: Example of the Duration Input Control


Time units can be entered into the control either singly or in combination, as illustrated in Figure 16.
The units supported are as follows:


 Years (for example, ‘y’)


 Months (for example, ‘m’)


 Weeks (for example, ‘w’)


 Days (for example, ‘d’)


 Hours (for example, ‘hr’)


 Minutes (for example, ‘min’)


 Seconds (for example, ‘sec’)


Figure 16: Example of Duration Elements


The duration control can be used independently or combined with date and time controls, as
illustrated in Figure 17. In this example, the duration is calculated from the start time and end time.
However, in another scenario, it may be appropriate to calculate the end time from the start time
and duration. The precise behaviour of such combined controls is at the discretion of the host ISV
application, as the required interaction between them will depend on the specific clinical context.

D+Tc-0031 Provide access to instructions on how to use the control, for example, via the use of tooltips. The
instructions must contain details of the different units that can be entered



Mandatory



D+Tc-0032 Allow entry of time duration units either singly or in combination Mandatory


D+Tc-0033 Allow editing of the individual elements of a duration Mandatory



D+Tc-0034 Ensure that the following minimal set of duration unit abbreviations is supported: **y** for years, **m** for
months, **w** for weeks, **d** for days, **hr** for hours, **min** for minutes and **sec** for seconds


D+Tc-0035 Allow the set of duration unit abbreviations to be extended appropriately, for example, ‘hrs’ as well
as ‘hr’. Ensure that any additions are unique within the entire set


D+Tc-0036 Allow the user to optionally enter white space within the duration input, for example, ‘3 hr 5 min’ as
well as ‘3hr 5min’


D+Tc-0037 Provide the facility for a user to disambiguate input which could be interpreted in more than one
way (see section 2.6), for example, ‘m’ (which could represent months or minutes)


D+Tc-0048 Where a time duration spans the change between GMT and BST, show a pop-up to inform the user
that the system will automatically handle the data within the appropriate time zone


D+Tc-0049 Where a user adjusts time manually resulting in a time duration spanning a change between GMT
and BST, show a pop-up to inform that user that the system will automatically adjust the data
according to the appropriate time zone

Table 16: Incorrect Examples of Using the Duration Control

##### **2.5.4 Rationale**


The rationale behind this guidance is to provide a simple and memorable notation that allows the
user to express a wide variety of time durations in an unambiguous, clear manner. Whilst the use of
a relatively constrained format for the display of durations helps to reduce confusion and
interpretation errors, allowing a flexible variety of formats for the input of durations improves the
overall usability of the control.

#### **2.6 Disambiguation of Input**


This section provides guidance for the disambiguation of input, using date as an example.


Disambiguation occurs once the user has entered a date into the date input control. At this point,
the user will be prompted to disambiguate an ambiguous date via an information message, as
illustrated in Figure 18. The user is prompted with options from which to select, including the option
to enter a different date.

![](datetime_assets/datetime.pdf-19-1.png)

Table 19: Incorrect Examples of Date Disambiguation

##### **2.6.4 Rationale**


The rationale behind this guidance is to provide a method by which the most common types of
ambiguous date can be identified and disambiguated at the point of entry. Most cases of
disambiguation will concern ambiguous date formats (such as dates where the day and month
value could be interchanged and still produce a valid date). These cases should be addressed by
the control itself using the instructional text in the message box. However, there will be other cases
where the input may be subject to validation rules that are external to the control and related to the
particular context of use. In such cases, the host ISV application may apply its own procedures for
data validation and error handling, which could give rise to warning messages such as:


 “The Finish date is before the Start date. Please enter a date after the Start date.”


 “The date of birth is in the future. Please enter the correct date of birth.”


In most cases, it would be logical to apply the internal disambiguation first and then subsequently
apply any external validation rules. However, the content of such rules and their precise usage is at
the discretion of the host ISV application as this will depend on the specific context of use.
