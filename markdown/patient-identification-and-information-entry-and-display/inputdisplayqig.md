#### **Guidance** **Introduction**

The NHS Number is a national unique patient identifier that makes it possible to share
patient information across the whole of the NHS safely, efficiently and accurately. It will be
read from screen displays and correlated with information in different media, for example,
wristbands (as described in _Standardising wristbands improves patient safety_ **[1]** ). It is a key
component of services such as the NHS Care Record, Choose and Book and the Electronic
Prescription Service. The NHS Number is described further in _NHS Number_ **[2]** .


**Important**


Although it contains all of the guidance points, this document omits supporting
information and is therefore not intended as a substitute for the full NHS CUI document
_Patient Identification Number Input and Display_ [3] . Refer to that document for the
definitive statement of the design guidance in this area.


The visual representations used to display the guidance are illustrative only. Stylistic
choices (for example, display font used), unless otherwise specified, are not part of the
guidance and are therefore not mandatory requirements.

### **NHS Number Input**

#### **Hints, Prompts and Tooltips**

The input control may provide a hint, prompt or tooltip. Hints are instructional text placed
outside but adjacent to the text input box. Prompts are commonly known as watermarks
and comprise instructional text placed within the text input box. Tooltips are instructional
text that appear when the mouse pointer is placed over the text input box.


The wording of hints and prompts is left to the designers of NHS clinical applications.
Examples of hints, prompts, and tooltips are shown below.
