**Patient Safety Process**
The development lifecycle for this design guide includes an integrated patient / clinical safety risk assessment and management process.
Known patient safety incidents relevant to this design guidance area have been researched and reviewed as part of ongoing development. The resulting guidance points aim to support mitigation of these known patient safety risks. In addition, the developers of this design guide have undertaken a patient safety risk assessment to identify new risks that could potentially be introduced by the guidance points in this document. Any potential risks identified have been assessed and managed to support the ongoing clinical safety case for this design guide.
The Hazard Log records all the risks that have been identified during development and describes mitigatory actions that, in some cases, will need to be taken by users of this design guide. The Hazard Log is a live document that is updated as the design guide is developed and maintained. Until this design guide has received full Clinical Authority to Release (CATR) from the NHS Connecting for Health (CFH) Clinical Safety Group (CSG) – based on an approved Clinical Safety Case – there may be outstanding patient safety risks yet to be identified and mitigated.
Additionally, users implementing applications that follow this design guide’s guidelines (for example, healthcare system suppliers) are expected to undertake further clinical safety risk assessments of their specific systems within their specific context of use.
Refer to [NHS Common User Interface for further information on the patient safety process and for](http://www.cui.nhs.uk/Pages/NHSCommonUserInterface.aspx) the safety status and any relevant accompanying safety documentation for this design guide.
### 1 INTRODUCTION

This document provides guidance for the design of Patient Lists. It describes the area of focus, lists mandatory and recommended guidance points with usage examples and explains the rationale behind the guidance.

To indicate their relative importance, each guideline in this document is ranked by **Conformance** and by **Evidence Rating** . Table 1 defines those terms:

Conformance Indicates the extent to which you should follow the guideline when defining your User Interface (UI) implementation. There are two levels:

 **Mandatory**         - An implementation should follow the guideline

 **Recommended**         - An implementation is advised to follow the guideline

Evidence Rating Summarises the strength of the research defining the guideline and the extent to which it mitigates patient safety hazards. There are three ratings (with example factors used to determine the appropriate rating):

 **Low** :

 Does not mitigate specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings unclear and with few participants

 Unreferenced usability principles indicate the design is not significantly better than alternatives

 **Medium** :

 Mitigates specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings clear but with few participants

 References old authoritative guidance (for example, from National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA),

Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) or World Health Organization (WHO)) that is potentially soon to be superseded

 Referenced usability principles indicate the design is significantly better than alternatives

 **High** :

 Mitigates specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings clear and with a significant number of participants

 References recent authoritative guidance (for example, from NPSA, ISMP or WHO)

 Referenced usability principles indicate the design is significantly better than alternatives

Table 1: Conformance and Evidence Rating Definitions

**Note**

Refer to section 5.2 for definitions of the specific terminology used in this document.

#### 1.1 Customer Need

Patient Lists are used in a wide range of clinical contexts within both primary and secondary care settings.

A Patient List comprises a structured list of patients specific to a service, a location or a care provider. For each patient, the list contains unique identification information and a subset of the patient’s health record appropriate to the use of the list.

Uses of Patient Lists include:

- Reviewing information about a set of patients

- Gaining an overview of their clinical situation

- Managing tasks

Figure 1 illustrates a Patient List that follows the guidance in this document:

Figure 1: Example Patient List Conformant to This Guidance, Populated with Fictitious Data

**Important**

The visual representations used within this document to display the guidance are illustrative only. They are simplified in order to support understanding of the guidance points. Stylistic choices, such as colours, fonts or icons are not part of the guidance and unless otherwise specified are not mandatory requirements for compliance with the guidance in this document.

Patient Lists may be used by an individual clinician (for example, consultant) or a team (for example, nursing team). The lists are typically used for a specific time period (for example, a shift) and are updated during this period if changes to the patient information occur.

During the research and collation of data for this document no guidance was found for a common presentation of Patient Lists as defined above.

During the development of this document, potential patient safety hazards around the display of patient data within a list were identified and recorded. The guidance within this document helps mitigate these recorded hazards and is determined by three key considerations:

- Users must be able to easily access the Patient List information they need

- Users must be able to quickly and easily familiarise themselves with the Patient List layout

on first use

- Users must be able to quickly understand how to manage the display of Patient List

information

This guidance covers the safe display of information for multiple patients in a Patient List format.

HSCIC Controlled Document

During research, the majority of identified potential patient safety hazards concerning Patient Lists applied to secondary care contexts, where teams of clinicians are caring for multiple patients in a single location (for example, a medical ward in a hospital). For this reason, the majority of examples provided throughout this document are based on a secondary care scenario, specifically a hospital respiratory ward. The medical information shown in these examples is fictitious but is based on the experiences of medical professionals who work or have recently worked on respiratory wards.

Listing an item as out of scope does not classify it as unimportant. Project time and resource constraints inevitably restrict what can be in scope for a particular release. It is possible that items out of scope for this release may be considered for a future release.

#### 1.3 Assumptions

**A1** The quality (that is, provenance, accuracy, and completeness) of the data displayed in the Patient List is of an acceptable level. Data quality is particularly important in scenarios where there are multiple data sources (as the quality of data may vary between sources).

**A2** Where the system supports the live update of Patient List information, the system performance and connectivity is of such a level that there is minimum delay between the update being entered and the Patient List being updated.

**A3** The minimum screen resolution used by the clinician is 1024 x 768 pixels, although a higher resolution may be employed.

**A4** The Patient List consists entirely of information that resides in and is accessible through other views, including views that represent the data as entered into the system.

In this incorrect example, the user has been permitted to resize the middle column narrower than the widest elements resulting in the words ‘Pancreatitis’ and ‘Cerebrovascular’ being truncated. (PAL-0210)

![](patlistview_assets/patlistview.pdf-23-0.png)
HSCIC Controlled Document

In this incorrect example, when the user resizes the first column, the other columns are automatically resized to maintain the overall width of the combined columns. As a consequence information has been relocated (for example, ‘Wednesday – on Potassium’ and ‘Diarrhoea’ are no longer in view). (This example assumes the user has not set a preference for this behaviour). (PAL-0220)

HSCIC Controlled Document

In this correct example, when the user resizes the third column (‘Presenting complaint’) the columns to the right remain the same width. The overall width has increased beyond the viewable area, so a horizontal scrollbar is displayed. The out-of-view symbols and warning message are displayed by default immediately above the viewable area. (PAL-0200, PAL-0220, PAL-0230, PAL-0240, PAL-0250, PAL-0260)

#### 5.2 Definitions

The Authority The organisation implementing the NHS National Programme for IT (currently NHS Connecting for Health).

Conformance In the guidance tables, indicates the extent to which you should follow the guideline when defining your UI implementation. There are two levels:

 **Mandatory**          - An implementation should follow the guideline

 **Recommended**          - An implementation is advised to follow the guideline

Current best practice Current best practice is used rather than best practice, as over time best practice guidance may change or be

revised due to changes to products, changes in technology, or simply the additional field deployment experience that comes over time.

Evidence Rating In the guidance tables, summarises the strength of the research defining the guideline and the extent to which it mitigates patient safety hazards. There are three ratings (with example factors used to determine the appropriate rating):

 **Low:**

 Does not mitigate specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings unclear and with few participants

 Unreferenced usability principles indicate the design is not significantly better than alternatives

 **Medium:**

 Mitigates specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings clear but with few participants

 References old authoritative guidance (for example, from National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA),

Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) or World Health Organization (WHO)) that is potentially soon to be superseded

 Referenced usability principles indicate the design is significantly better than alternatives

 **High:**

 Mitigates specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings clear and with a significant number of participants

 References recent authoritative guidance (for example, from NPSA, ISMP or WHO)

 Referenced usability principles indicate the design is significantly better than alternatives

### APPENDIX B STUDY ID 77: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

#### B.1 Abstract

The UK National Health Service (NHS) Common User Interface (CUI) programme is a partnership between Microsoft [®] and NHS Connecting for Health (NHS CFH), which is part the NHS National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT).

As part of CUI, the Clinical Applications and Patient Safety (CAPS) project has the goal of ensuring that software applications used by the NHS enhance patient safety. To achieve this, CAPS provides software developers with user interface design guidelines derived through a user-centric development process that includes explicit patient-safety evaluations.

This summary describes key findings from user research carried out in November 2009 by the CUI CAPS team on Patient List Views. These findings are a subset of those in a larger internal report prepared for the CUI CAPS Patient List Views team.

**Purpose:**

To gain clinical feedback on designs for Patient List Views.

**Method:**

Interviews: structured interviews with 11 Health Care Professionals (HCPs) eliciting HCP preferences and qualitative feedback on designs.

**Key Results:**

Based on clinician preference and rationale:

- Truncating items in sublists is problematic and may hinder use of the view

- The option for end-user clinicians to be able to customise the dataset visible should be

further explored

- Marking of updates was a popular feature, though unmarking was initially unclear

- A ‘snapshots’ feature was also liked, primarily in order to access patients no longer on the

current list

#### B.1 Research Objectives

To gather HCP preferences and qualitative feedback on, and to identify possible patient safety hazards with, CUI Patient List designs.

#### B.2 Research Design

11 clinicians were interviewed across 11 structured 1 hour interviews, carried out in person. Participants were shown static designs of the Patient List View, with design alternatives per design area. Designs and example data used a secondary care inpatient scenario.

Participants were asked for preferences based on patient safety criteria. Other qualitative feedback was elicited covering:

- Rationale for preference

- Design fit with current and best practice

- Design understandability

- Any potential hazards resulting from the designs

Detailed notes from the interviews were qualitatively analysed using thematic coding.

#### B.3 Results

##### B.3.1 Participant Description

11 participants were interviewed in 11 sessions. Each had either volunteered through the NHS CFH Event Management System (EMS) signup or had been recruited by an HCP who had volunteered. 5 out of 11 participants had previously taken part in CUI clinical engagement for other work areas.

All participants were clinical staff who used patient lists as part of their role, generally for handover and supporting their work on the wards. The majority of the participants were junior doctors. Participants were from a number of different trusts around the UK.

The majority had had no experience of using electronic patient lists.

##### B.3.2 Design Areas

Bullet text _in italics_ represents researcher recommendations or comments in order to distinguish them from user feedback.

_**Current Practice**_

- Inpatient lists are used by junior doctors as “an aide memoire so you know where they are,

who they are, what they are, and what you’ve done” (p435)

- Several participants described using old versions of the patient list (usually from the

previous day) for:

 Backup – Due to still-relevant information not being transferred to the new version

 To see what had happened to patients no longer on the ward, in particular where they had been moved to

 To track the responsible staff on duty on a particular day

 To track infection risks

_**Too Much Data**_

- Participants were shown three designs for dealing with large numbers of items in a cell

sublist (for example, tasks)

- The most serious risks were with the design that forced the clinician to scroll the list within

the cell as this prevented them from comparing across patient’s tasks both within and between patients. They might forget to scroll, and they might mistakenly assume that the items were in order of importance (when it is likely they would not be as this is hard to reliably determine and varies depending on your clinical perspective)

- Advantages of showing all items in a sublist without truncation were that all items across all

patients could (in theory) be seen in ‘one go’, though, as each patient row was likely to be much higher in this case, the clinician would have to do more scrolling and/or paging in order to see and compare items between patients

- _All current paper patient lists follow an untruncated model_

- Participants suggested that a short list of patients might be useful to get an overview of the

location or as a way to select a patient

_**Current Dataset Variation**_

- As has been seen from analysis of current inpatient paper lists, participants described how

different wards can have very different datasets (for example, a general medical ward compared to a labour ward) and some modelled in different ways (for example, organising data by the body system in the Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU)):

 _Implying that a patient list design cannot ignore the issue of varying datasets between_ _wards and/or contexts_

_**Changing Dataset**_

- Participants were shown different designs for user-variation of the visible dataset. Issues

arising were:

 Disorientating ‘jumping’ if datasets were presented on different pages (in that the clinician has to re-find the patient they were interested in)

 Having to re-read information if datasets were presented on different pages

Page 65

Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre

HSCIC Controlled Document

 The desire to be able to compare attributes for a given patient (difficult if attributes were always displayed on separate pages)

 The belief among junior doctors that a dataset would be determined by senior staff (and possibly even non-clinical staff) and would likely be inappropriate for the juniors’ needs. Therefore, they would like the ability to vary the dataset themselves

 The desire for different roles to be able to access different datasets

 A desire to guide new staff to a recommended dataset for them in their context

 A desire to be able to vary the dataset visible dependant on patient or clinical situation

 All participants preferred a design where they could fully customise the visible dataset:

 However, this may have been influenced by a desire to account for varying datasets per ward _(which does not necessarily imply that the end-user can vary the dataset)_

- Various risks were raised with the ability for the end-user to fully customise the visible

dataset

_**Updates**_

- All participants liked the idea of marking the updates since you last saw the list:

 One participant pointed out this would be of most value in a larger team where many people were making updates to the same patients during a day (p437)

- It was not seen as necessary to indicate times of updates in this view

- Participants were unclear as to whether the update count included those updates on

columns out of view

- The first five participants shown the design initially (mistakenly) assumed unmarking would

clear all the updates from the whole team’s view and didn’t like this, preferring the update unmarking to be personal

- Other participants discussed the merits of using the updates as a kind of ‘micro-handover’

acknowledgement, in that the marking and unmarking could be shared between the team to indicate acceptance of information and tasks:

 _Following internal CUI discussion, it was felt that this kind of functionality was both out_ _of scope for this work and probably best left to a ‘proper’ communications feature_

_**Snapshots**_

- All six participants asked confirmed that they did want to know about patients who had

previously been on the ward (which is not possible from a continually updated patient list view)

- This was mainly seen as a learning opportunity, an aid in finding the patient, for checking

tasks were done for patients now not on the ward and for quick access when writing the discharge summary

 _A previous version of the patient list would mean that a clinician could find the patient’s_ _details without having to remember unique identifiers and searching for them in the_ _Patient Administration System (PAS), which may be unsuccessful or error prone as_ _patients’ unique identifiers are hard to remember_

_**History**_

- Response was generally ambivalent, with no strong opinions for or against viewing a

per-patient history

Page 66

HSCIC Controlled Document

_**Opening More Details**_

- The option to show more details for one patient at the same time as the patient list was only

discussed with four participants but there were more risks elicited for having the option than not having it

- It was suggested that, given space constraints, there would in any case be a limit to how

much extra information would be able to be usefully seen at the same time

_**Multiple Wards**_

- All six participants asked were initially confused by the ‘mixed’ list and all described the

benefits of seeing the patients grouped or ordered by ward
