**Patient Safety Process**


The development lifecycle for this design guide includes an integrated patient / clinical safety risk
assessment and management process.


Known patient safety incidents relevant to this design guidance area have been researched and
reviewed as part of ongoing development. The resulting guidance points aim to support mitigation
of these known patient safety risks. In addition, the developers of this design guide have
undertaken a patient safety risk assessment to identify new risks that could potentially be
introduced by the guidance points in this document. Any potential risks identified have been
assessed and managed to support the ongoing clinical safety case for this design guide.


The Hazard Log records all the risks that have been identified during development and describes
mitigatory actions that, in some cases, will need to be taken by users of this design guide. The
Hazard Log is a live document that is updated as the design guide is developed and maintained.
Until this design guide has received full Clinical Authority to Release (CATR) from the NHS
Connecting for Health (CFH) Clinical Safety Group (CSG) – based on an approved Clinical Safety
Case – there may be outstanding patient safety risks yet to be identified and mitigated.


Additionally, users implementing applications that follow this design guide’s guidelines (for
example, healthcare system suppliers) are expected to undertake further clinical safety risk
assessments of their specific systems within their specific context of use.


[Refer to www.cui.nhs.uk](https://emea.mail.microsoft.com/OWA/redir.aspx?C=2aab7991b0924c8f92c4e2824ab8a971&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cui.nhs.uk) for further information on the patient safety process and for the safety
status and any relevant accompanying safety documentation for this design guide.

### 1 INTRODUCTION


This document provides guidance for the design of a Micro Patient Banner (MPB). It describes the
area of focus, lists mandatory and recommended guidance points with usage examples and
explains the rationale behind the guidance.


The term ‘patient banner’ (PAB) refers to the area of the user interface that contains demographic
information for a patient record. The patient banner is the area within the user interface that is most
often used to match records with patients and contains key information for identifying patients, such
as name, address, date of birth, and NHS number. This information may be matched with that
provided by the patient (or a third party, such as a parent), usually in their presence or over the
telephone. Information in a patient banner may also be matched with that in any of the patient’s
associated artefacts, such as samples, letters, specimens, wristbands and X-rays.


The Micro Patient Banner is a patient banner designed for small screen, hand-held devices such as
Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). Its purpose is to display patient demographic information for
the patient whose record is currently being viewed on the PDA, so that health care staff can ensure
the correct patient is identified and the correct record is displayed, as shown in Figure 1:


Figure 1: A Micro Patient Banner Displayed on a PDA


**Note**


Existing NHS Common User Interface (CUI) guidance on the full-screen Patient Banner is targeted at
desktop monitors. Its title is _Design Guide Entry – Patient Banner_ **{R1}** .


**Important**


The visual representations used within this document to display the guidance are illustrative only. Stylistic
choices, unless otherwise specified, are not part of the guidance and are therefore not mandatory
requirements for compliance with the guidance in this document.

**Deleted** None


**Modified** Enhanced out of scope context setting (section 1.2.2)

**Added** Patient Safety Process note


Table 1: Changes Since the Last Baseline Version

#### **1.1 Customer Need**

The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) [1] states that, although there are no accurate figures on
the frequency or cost of mismatching errors, they form a significant part of the whole range of
errors in health care. These mismatches can occur between a patient, their record, laboratory
results and, in the case of inpatients, their wristband. Whilst the wide variation in wristbands used in
the NHS has now been addressed by a standard [2], there is considerable variation in patient banner
layout across applications, which has already been the subject of CUI guidance **{R1}** . When errors
do occur, they are typically one of three main types **{R2}** :


1. The patient is given the wrong treatment due to failure to identify the patient correctly


2. The patient is given the wrong treatment as a result of a failure to match the patient

correctly with samples, specimens or X-rays


3. The patient is given the wrong treatment as a result of a failure in communication between

staff, or due to staff not performing checking procedures correctly


In addition to the NPSA, accurate patient identification is emphasised by the World Health
Organization (WHO) publication on _Patient Safety Solutions_ **{R4}**, and by the Joint Commission
**{R5}**, both of whom provide guidance on how to improve patient identification.


Handheld computers, that is PDAs, are increasingly being used by health care staff. For a list of the
many uses to which they are being applied in a health care setting, refer to _Handheld Computers_
**{R6}** . For details of adoption rates, refer to _Who’s Using PDAs?_ **{R7}** .


This Micro Patient Banner design guidance is restricted to PDA usage and aims to:


 Ensure patients are correctly identified and matched with their patient record and wristband

**{R3}** by displaying data items consistently


 Allow quick access to and display of other summary information for a patient (such as the

address)


Significant inconsistencies exist across existing micro patient banners used in PDA-based clinical
applications displaying patient information. This has a large but unquantifiable cost in terms of
incorrect identification of patients, leading to safety issues and, potentially, additional staff training.
Reduction of inconsistency is therefore an important goal in itself. Finally, having a consistent,

agreed layout for micro patient banners in clinical systems makes the design and development of
such systems easier and quicker.

#### **1.2 Scope**


The guidance in this document informs the design of a patient-safe micro patient banner to support
one task, namely patient identification. This section details the items that are in scope, and those
that are out of scope, with respect to this guidance.

##### **1.2.1 In Scope**


This guidance is applicable to User Interfaces (UIs) such as those displayed on hand-held devices,
also known as PDAs. These devices are characterised by a small display screen size, typically
quoted by manufacturers as about 4 inches (that is, approximately 10 centimetres) in diagonal. It is
assumed that, as a minimum, these devices are capable of operating at a display resolution greater
than or equal to 240 x 320 pixels, but less than 1024 x 768 pixels, and have a pointing device such
as a stylus.


This guidance informs the design of demographic information displays to support the identification
of a single patient, safely and accurately. It is applicable for all care settings. This guidance was
developed primarily to support the work of the following health care staff as these are especially
likely not to have a previous relation with the patient. Additionally, they are the most likely users of
a hand-held device such as a PDA (this guidance is not limited to these roles but applies across all
health care staff in the NHS):


1. Inpatient doctor


2. Night nurse practitioner


3. Out of hours GP


4. First response paramedic


5. District nurse


6. Bank nurse

##### **1.2.2 Out of Scope**


This section defines areas that are not covered in this guidance. Although there may be specific
risks associated with these areas that are not addressed in this guidance, it is likely that the
principles in this guidance will extend to micro patient banner aspects in many of the areas listed
below.


The following items are out of scope:


 The display of clinical information


 The modification of demographic information


 The display of information for more than one patient at a time


 Information governance, security and confidentiality


 The following form factors: wall-mounted screens, whiteboards, projected images, desktop

monitors, Tablet PCs, telephones, and Smartphones


 Displaying alerts in an MPB


 Displaying an MPB in a pop-up window


 Multi-language applications that use right-to-left writing (such as Arabic), the Cyrillic

alphabet (such as Russian), or ideograms (such as Japanese)

HSCIC Controlled Document


 Display styles such as the choice of font size, background and foreground text colour that

can affect the readability of information in the MPB, as with all other displayed text


 Bar code representations (such as a patient identification number in the form of a bar code)


**Note**


Listing an item as out of scope does not classify it as unimportant. Project time and resource constraints
inevitably restrict what can be in scope for a particular release. It is possible that items out of scope for
this release may be considered for a future release.

#### **1.3 Assumptions**


**A1** Existing CUI Guidance on the Patient Banner is targeted at desktop monitors and is an important reference document but is
not automatically applicable to the MPB


**A2** The ‘log in’ dialogue is out of scope and users are assumed to have logged in successfully to the application running on the
PDA in order to view the patient record and MPB


**A3** All aspects relating to security, privacy and data protection are out of scope of the MPB work


**A4** A MPB is not to be used within a Patient List, but is displayed after a single patient has been selected from a Patient List


**A5** In line with NHS policy, use of the NHS Number is to be encouraged, hence the MPB will not display any local patient
identification numbers


**A6** Whilst the MPB has not been designed for use by patients, health care staff may at their discretion, show an MPB to patients


**A7** This guidance is equally applicable on devices used in portrait and in landscape display modes


Table 2: Assumptions

#### **1.4 Dependencies**


**D1** Ongoing and unpublished work by the NHS National Programme for IT (NPfIT) that is referred to in this document as NHS
Connecting for Health (NHS CFH), such as on the display of gender and sex


**D2** Changes to the information defined in the Personal Demographics Service (PDS [3] )


**D3** Changes to any of the documents listed in the References section in this guidance document

### 3 MICRO PATIENT BANNER GUIDANCE DETAILS

#### **3.1 Introduction**


The guidance provided in this document is based upon a programme of research, including:


 A Web based survey of clinicians and administrative staff covering a range of patient

identification issues **{R16}**


 One-to-one interviews with a range of healthcare professionals **{R17}**


 A plenary discussion with members of the Clinical Spine Application (CSA) Design Steering

Group

#### **3.2 Principles**


The following key principles have shaped the guidance in this document:


 Reliable and accurate identification of an individual patient record


 Matching a patient record with:


 The correct patient, whether present in person or by phone


 Other artefacts associated with the patient, for example, samples, letters, or wristbands


 Displaying core information according to existing standards and guidance and using a

minimum data set available to all NHS clinical applications

|Col1|Rationale|
|---|---|
||User feedback indicated that the labels ‘Born’, ‘Died’, ‘Preferred name’ and ‘NHS No.’ were seen as most suitable for the date of birth,<br>date of death, preferred name and NHS number respectively**{R18}**. For example, ‘DoB’ and ‘DoD’ were determined to be hard to<br>differentiate visually; additionally some screen readers read aloud ‘DoB’ as ‘dob’.<br>To guide the user’s eye to relevant information, the font size and weight must be chosen so more visual emphasis is given to data<br>values than to their corresponding labels. Data values may, therefore, be rendered in, for example, a larger font size or with greater<br>weight than the corresponding labels to help users locate the required information efficiently. The corresponding data text style and<br>label text style are not specified here but are left to the designers of software applications to choose. As per NHS CUI Accessibility<br>guidance**{R14, R15}**, users should be allowed to set their own font preferences to maximise readability.<br>For a living patient, the patient’s age is displayed in parentheses and a label is not included as displaying the actual age alongside the<br>date of birth makes the value self-explanatory. In addition, the parentheses separate the age from the other text placed nearby and<br>give the age a unique style, helping users to identify this part of the display efficiently.<br>For a deceased patient, there is again a need to give the age a unique style so as to ensure users do not mistake a deceased patient<br>for one who is alive, nor vice versa. This is achieved by doing the converse to the case of a living patient, namely, by displaying a label<br>with the age, which is displayed without parentheses.<br>The display of an age value has been considered carefully for the range of patients from babies to adults. Short, that is, abbreviated<br>units are used to save on space in the already constrained Micro Patient Banner. Additionally, only two units are used, a lower and an<br>upper unit, without any intermediate units, further economising on space without compromising the displayed value. The permitted<br>abbreviations for the units are listed in the_Design Guide Entry – Time Display_**{R9}.**<br>Here is a summary of the age bands with their lower and higher units:<br>**Age**<br>**Lower Unit**<br>**Higher Unit**<br>< 2 hours<br>Minutes<br>Minutes<br>< 2 days<br>Hours<br>Hours<br>< 4 weeks<br>Days<br>Days<br>< 1 year<br>Weeks<br>Days<br>< 2 years<br>Months<br>Days<br>< 18 years<br>Years<br>Months<br>>= 18 years<br>Years<br>Years<br>Here are examples of the display of a patient’s age:<br>**Age**<br>**Display**<br>1 hour 30 minutes<br>90min<br>1 day 2 hours 5 minutes<br>26hrs<br>3 days 17 hours 7 minutes<br>3d<br>27 days 5 hours 2 minutes<br>27d<br>28 days 5 hours 2 minutes<br>4w<br>29 days 5 hours 2 minutes<br>4w 1d<br>1 year 1 day 5 hours<br>12m 1d<br>1 year 8 days 5 hours<br>12m 8d<br>1 year 39 days 5 hours<br>13m 8d<br>4 years 39 days<br>4y 1m|

Labelling the information according to the above guidance confers the following benefits:

 Users can clearly differentiate between data items (see _How to limit clinical error in interpretation of data_ [6] )

 Users are less likely to be confused about what certain data values represent, for example, a date on its own could be a date of

birth or a date of death

 The user is able to read patient identification information in an unambiguous, consistent way wherever this information might

appear

This guidance supports the need for flexibility on the part of application designers by leaving open the choice of:

 Data and label text styles

 Label definitions. Definitions must be provided for all labels. The suggested definition for NHS number is: ‘A ten-digit number used

to identify a person uniquely within the NHS in England and Wales’ **{R12}**

 Means to access the definitions and the record


User research **{R16, R17}** with NHS health care staff has shown that using an icon such as or to display a patient’s gender is
not understood. NHS CUI guidance for sex and gender display **{R11}**, based on the _NHS Data Model and Dictionary_ **{R25}**, also
specifies other permissible values (namely ‘Not known’ and ‘Not Specified’) for which there are no graphical representations. For these
reasons, this guidance prohibits all pictorial forms of displaying gender in the MPB. A common form for displaying gender is in
abbreviated form, such as ‘M’ for male and ‘F’ for female. While these are more intuitively understood, the problem remains for the
other values, for which any abbreviation would be ambiguous. The overarching principle, which applies across all items in a MPB, is to
always display the minimum data set and accompanying labels in full, provided screen space allows for this. Any departures from this
principle should be based on sound safety assessments.

As already discussed, for age and for address, gender is not a core item of information for patient identification **{R3}**, but is a helpful
item when resolving multiple matches or when addressing a patient. In the user research, a participant commented that “ _Having_
_gender displayed reduces the chance of mistaken identity by half. It is good to know the gender when discussing patients with relatives_
_and over the phone, so that the correct personal pronouns can be used. This saves anxiety and embarrassment”._ Its display is
therefore not mandatory but, when displayed, the label ‘Gender’ must be used rather than ‘Sex’ as, for patient identification, the
patient’s current gender classification is more relevant than that recorded at birth. Comments were also made by participants about the
difference between sex and gender and that the former is used for clinical purposes (such as for prescribing). However, this difference
between sex and gender was not understood by all participants in the user research, a number of whom saw these terms as being
synonymous. To emphasise the difference, this guidance advises that suitable cautionary information be provided to users. The
suggested definition for gender is: ‘Gender: a person’s current gender. This may be different from a person’s sex, which is a person’s
gender defined at the point of birth registration.’

A further aspect mentioned by one participant in the user research was the need to know whether a patient was of transgender or
whether the sex and gender differed. These aspects stray from the aim of the Micro Patient Banner and therefore the guidance does
not advise displaying such information.

The label ‘Born’ is mandated, though wristband guidance uses ‘Date of Birth’, because the former is shorter and screen space is
limited on the MPB. In the user research, one person commented that the label helps “ _To avoid confusion with today's date [for] new_
_born babies_ .”

Finally, reference to tooltips is only to serve as an example, not as a recommended design choice. Indeed, tooltips may not be
supported by the operating system software running on the PDA, as these do not typically support stylus-hover behaviour in the way
that desktops support mouse-hover behaviour. One can envisage a tooltip-like display style activated upon touch instead of on hover.
However, the guidance does not require that PDAs used for clinical applications must have touch-sensitive screens. The guidance
endeavours to be platform-agnostic, so simply emphasises the need to support on-demand explanatory information to the user in a
form suited to the chosen platform. In addition to the suggested definition for gender given above, the following definitions are
suggested:

 Patient name: ‘The patient’s family name, followed by their given name’

 Date of birth: ‘The patient’s date of birth’.

#### **3.4 Rationale Summary**

The guidance in this document mitigates patient safety issues that arise during patient
identification.


General Principles:


 Reliable and accurate identification of an individual patient record


 Matching a patient record with:


 The correct patient, whether present in person or on the telephone


 Other artefacts associated with the patient (for example, samples, letters or wristbands)


 Displaying core information according to existing standards and guidance and using a

minimum data set available to all NHS clinical applications


 Promoting consistency across the mix of users, NHS clinical applications and care settings


 Displaying minimum supplementary information to support patient identification


 Minimising opportunities for human error


Usability Principles:


 Enhance readability of data over that of corresponding labels


 Separate primary data required for patient identification from secondary supporting data


 Permanent display of primary data for frequent and efficient access


 On-demand display of secondary data to reduce screen clutter
