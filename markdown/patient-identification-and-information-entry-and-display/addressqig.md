#### Introduction Introduction

Record and display postal addresses in clinical applications accurately and consistently in order to support:

  - Patient identification

  - Service delivery (such as sending appointment letters)

  - Data interoperability

**Important**

Although it contains all of the guidance points, this document omits supporting information and is therefore not intended as a substitute for the full NHS CUI document _Address Input and Display_ **[1]** . Refer to that document for the definitive statement of the design guidance in this area.

The visual representations used to display the guidance are illustrative only. Stylistic choices (for example, display font used), unless otherwise specified, are not part of the guidance and are therefore not mandatory requirements.

#### Guidance

### UK Address Input

The minimum number of data elements required for input of a UK address can vary. Many addresses will only require three elements:

     - House number and street

     - Town or city

     - Postcode

However, addresses outside of London will require a ‘County’ and all addresses might need the name of a locality or suburb. During design, reference should be made to the _NHS Data Model and Dictionary_ **[1]** and the _NHS Connecting for Health_ _Personal Demographics Service_ (PDS) **[2]** to ensure that content and field lengths comply with the requisite standards.

Where possible, designers of NHS clinical applications should consider validation of the address at time of input in line with PDS entry order.

#### Guidance

### UK Address Finder

A UK address finder should only be provided if the clinical application supports a postcode-based address lookup service. Typically, all the matching addresses found in the database are displayed in an address picker. The user then selects one of these addresses and it is stored as if the user had input the whole address.

Thought the guidance does not define it, the finder control may provide additional text by using hints, prompts or tool tips.
