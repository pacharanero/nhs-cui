**Patient Safety Process**


The development lifecycle for this design guide includes an integrated patient / clinical safety risk
assessment and management process.


Known patient safety incidents relevant to this design guidance area have been researched and
reviewed as part of ongoing development. The resulting guidance points aim to support mitigation
of these known patient safety risks. In addition, the developers of this design guide have
undertaken a patient safety risk assessment to identify new risks that could potentially be
introduced by the guidance points in this document. Any potential risks identified have been
assessed and managed to support the ongoing clinical safety case for this design guide.


The Hazard Log records all the risks that have been identified during development and describes
mitigatory actions that, in some cases, will need to be taken by users of this design guide. The
Hazard Log is a live document that is updated as the design guide is developed and maintained.
Until this design guide has received full Clinical Authority to Release (CATR) from the NHS
Connecting for Health (CFH) Clinical Safety Group (CSG) – based on an approved Clinical Safety
Case – there may be outstanding patient safety risks yet to be identified and mitigated.


Additionally, users implementing applications that follow this design guide’s guidelines (for
example, healthcare system suppliers) are expected to undertake further clinical safety risk
assessments of their specific systems within their specific context of use.


[Refer to www.cui.nhs.uk](https://emea.mail.microsoft.com/OWA/redir.aspx?C=2aab7991b0924c8f92c4e2824ab8a971&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cui.nhs.uk) for further information on the patient safety process and for the safety
status and any relevant accompanying safety documentation for this design guide.

### 1 INTRODUCTION


This document describes the design guidance for the display and input of information about patient
‘Sex’ or ‘Current Gender’ status. It describes the area of focus, provides guidance and
recommendations, and explains the rationale behind the guidance and recommendations.


The term ‘Gender’ is now considered too ambiguous to be desirable or safe because different
locations and systems use it to mean different things. It is therefore desirable to use the two distinct
terms ‘Sex’ and ‘Current Gender’.


**Note**


Elements used within a software application are commonly referred to as a ‘control’. These can take many
forms but the types referred to in this document will either be ‘input controls’ that can receive input from a
user, such as a button, text box, option button (radio button) or check box, or ‘display controls’ such as a
label, which can only display information.


The Current Gender input controls are used to record the gender, according to how a patient
currently describes themselves, whereas the Sex input controls records their _phenotypic_ sex (see
section 2.4 for more information).


This document outlines the design guidance for the display of these statuses. Figure 1 shows an
example format of these statuses:


Figure 1: Example of the Format for Displaying Gender and Sex in NHS Clinical Applications


This document also outlines the design guidance for the input of these statuses; Figure 2 shows
some examples of input design:


Figure 2: Example Input Designs for Current Gender and Sex Statuses


This document is intended for use by anyone whose role includes screen design, implementation,
or assessment of an NHS clinical application. This document can be used as guidance for the:


 Specification of an input and display control for the Sex and/or Current Gender statuses in a

user interface


 Implementation of an input and display control for Sex and/or Current Gender within an

application


 Assessment of an input and display control for Sex and/or Current Gender in the user

interface for an NHS clinical application

3.0.0.0 dated 07-Apr-2008):


**Deleted** None


**Modified** Enhanced out of scope context setting (section 1.2.2)


Enhanced research setting (section 2)


**Added** Patient Safety Process note


Table 1: Changes Since the Last Baseline Version

#### **1.1 Customer Need**


This section explains why the guidance has been created.


The NHS categorises a person's gender in two ways:


 **Person Gender Current** . Or ‘Current Gender’, which refers to a patient's current gender

classification.


 **Person Gender at Registration** . Or ‘Sex’, which refers to the record of a patient's gender

classification at the point of birth registration.


**Note**


For brevity and clarity, this document uses the term Sex in place of Person Gender at Registration and
Current Gender in place of Person Gender Current.


NHS applications input and display a patient's current gender or sex in various contexts. Users may
confuse the terms current gender and sex, or assume that they are synonymous. Therefore, it is
essential that all NHS applications display and explain current gender and sex terminology and
values in a clear and consistent manner.


This document details the recommendations for entering and displaying current gender and sex in
NHS applications. NHS clinical applications should use the Current Gender and Sex format to
enhance readability, ensure consistency and to cover all possible variants of Current Gender and
Sex. This recommendation provides the best display format because it decreases ambiguity
through the clear presentation of data values, and intuitive, concise labelling of patient Current
Gender and Sex. Additionally, this recommendation enables NHS clinical applications to display a
predefined, restricted set of unknown or unspecified Current Gender and Sex values. Figure 1
shows examples of how an NHS application might display Current Gender and Sex values.


The aims of this guidance are to:


 Ensure patients are correctly identified and matched with their patient record by displaying

data items consistently


 Allow the status of the patient to be entered and displayed in a legally compliant and

patient-sensitive manner


Potential consequences of not adhering to these standards include:


1. The patient is given the wrong treatment as a result of a failure to identify the patient

correctly.


2. The patient is given the wrong treatment as a result of a failure to match the patient

correctly with their artefacts (samples, letters, specimens, X-rays, and so on).


3. The patient is given the wrong treatment as a result of a failure in communication between

staff, or staff not performing or checking procedures correctly.

HSCIC Controlled Document


4. The patient is categorised with a value that cannot be utilised by any other systems.


5. The patient is categorised incorrectly from a legal perspective.


6. The patient is categorised incorrectly from their perspective.


This guidance is concerned with each of the errors identified above, but particularly points 1 and 2.

#### **1.2 Scope**


This section defines the scope of this guidance document.

##### **1.2.1 In Scope**


This guidance is applicable primarily to electronic user interfaces such as those displayed on
desktop, laptop, and PDA computers. However, many of the principles can also be applied to paper
form design. It is assumed that these computers are capable of displaying Graphical User Interface
(GUI) elements (such as buttons) and have a keyboard and pointing device. The following items
are in scope:


 Defining the valid values for current gender and sex


 Labelling of information, including:


 Definition of the terms Current Gender and Sex


 Definition of the values


 How items of information are to be labelled; this will cover the label text, positioning and
any elements of styling required to differentiate labels visually from data


 Control layout and structure, in order to achieve:


 Optimal visibility of the values


 Easy recognition of the values in the context of the wider clinical application


 Easy recognition of the data type requested for input


 Reduction of invalid entries

##### **1.2.2 Out of Scope**


This section defines areas that are not covered in this guidance. Although there may be specific
risks associated with these areas that are not addressed in this guidance, it is likely that the
principles in this guidance will extend to the input and display of sex and current gender in many of
the areas listed below.


The following items are out of scope:


 **Data storage**  - This guidance does not prescribe the format for storing data that is input or

displayed


 **Terms of use**  - This guidance does not define when an input field or display should be

presented within a system or when Current Gender should be used instead of Sex, and vice
versa


 **Form design**  - This guidance does not prescribe the correct layout for a form or the

navigation around a form

**Note**


Listing an item as out of scope does not classify it as unimportant. Project time and resource constraints
inevitably restrict what can be in scope for a particular release. It is possible that items out of scope for
this release may be considered for a future release.

#### **1.3 Dependencies and Assumptions**


Compliance with other guidance is required as follows:


 The design of NHS clinical applications must conform to _Accessibility Checkpoints for NHS_

_Clinical Applications_ **{R1}** and _Accessibility for Clinical Applications_ **{R2}**


**Important**


The visual representations used within this document to display guidance are illustrative only. Stylistic
choices are not part of guidance and are therefore not mandatory requirements for compliance with the
guidance in this document.

#### **1.4 Key Principles**


The following key principles have shaped the guidance in this document:


 Display information according to existing standards


 Minimise opportunities for human error


 Display sufficient instructional information to support data quality


 Promote consistency across the mix of users, NHS clinical applications and care settings


 Ensure reliable and accurate identification of an individual patient record


 Minimise opportunities where patient-clinician relationships may be compromised

### 2 RECOMMENDATIONS AND GUIDANCE


The guidance provided in this document is based on a programme of user research, including:


 The evaluation of the following organisations' key standards (where relevant, standards will

have been approved by the Information Standards Board for Health and Social Care (ISB
HaSC)):


 NHS Connecting for Health Data Dictionary


 UK Government Data Standards Catalogue (GDSC)


 NHS Connecting for Health Personal Demographics Service (PDS)


 NHS Connecting for Health Message Implementation Manual (MIM)


 A desk-based research project looking at a range of information entry Web pages and

clinical applications


 A Web-based survey of 41 respondents from NHS clinicians and administrative staff,

Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), community pharmacists and NHS CFH


 A Patient Safety Assessment

#### **2.1 Current Gender Values**


Any Current Gender input or display control is restricted to the predefined set of valid values shown
in Table 1.


**Important**


The values defined in this document are based upon the current proposed changes to the NHS CFH Data
Dictionary. Should future changes be made to this document, amendments to this guidance will be
required.

##### **2.1.1 Guidance**

CGS-0006 Do not display the underlying coded representation of the Current Gender data values. For
example, the standard code for 'Male' may be the integer 1, but this number should not
appear.



Mandatory



CGS-0007 Label the Current Gender status display 'Current Gender'. Recommended


CGS-0008 Use ‘Not Known’ as the Current Gender default value. Recommended

Table 4: Incorrect Gender Formatting Examples

##### **2.1.4 Rationale**



**Patient-Safety-Critical**

This example requires the user to understand and interpret
the numeric codes or abbreviations. This representation is
likely to cause recognition errors.


**Lack of Readability**

This example lacks clarity and readability by displaying both
number and textual values for Current Gender. The relative
number values could also cause offence.



The values defined here represent the current best conclusions from the healthcare industry on
valid values for these statuses.


The use of an unambiguous alphabetical string is considered the most predictable and
recognisable format for clinicians using the systems.

#### **2.2 Sex Values**


Any Sex input or display control is restricted to the predefined set of valid values shown in Table 5.


**Important**


The values defined in this document are based upon the current proposed changes to the NHS Data
Dictionary. Should future changes be made to this document, amendments to this guidance will be
required.

##### **2.2.1 Guidance**

Table 7: Incorrect Sex Formatting Examples

##### **2.2.4 Rationale**



**Patient-Safety-Critical**

This example requires the user to understand and interpret
the numeric codes or abbreviations. This representation is
likely to cause recognition errors.


**Lack of Readability**

This example lacks clarity and readability by displaying both
number and textual values for Sex.



The values defined here represent the current best practice regarding the use of this data area.


The use of a discrete alphabetical string is considered the most predictable and recognisable
format for clinicians using the systems.

#### **2.3 Instructional Text**


The Current Gender and Sex controls are potentially confusing to the user due to the terms Sex
and Gender being used inconsistently between systems and locations. It is therefore very important
to facilitate a user's understanding of a data item through the use of instructional text.


**Important**


This section is illustrated with examples using tooltips, however, instructional text can be provided in a
variety of methods; which method is to be employed is not considered in this document as this is a
system-wide issue rather than a specific one.

##### **2.3.1 Current Gender Instructional Text**


At this time, the term ‘Current Gender’ is not in widespread use and, as a result, could be confusing
to the user. Therefore, the control label must provide the following definition:


Current Gender, as assigned by the individual to themselves


One method of achieving this is using a tooltip, as displayed in Figure 3:


Figure 3: Brief Definition of Current Gender from Control Label (Via a Tooltip)


Page 8

![](sex_assets/sex.pdf-11-1.png)
HSCIC Controlled Document


ISVs need to take responsibility for informing the user about this control by providing the following
instructional text in the format required by their application:


Current Gender is a statement by the individual about the gender they currently identify themselves to be (that is,
self-assigned). The valid values are:

 **Male**

 **Female**

 **Other Specific**  - when the person has a clear idea of what their gender is, but it is neither discretely male nor female,

for example, 'Intersex', 'transgender', 'third gender'

 **Not Known**  - used when no information on this subject is known

 **Not Specified**  - when the person is unable to specify their current gender or does not have a clear idea of their

current gender

##### **2.3.2  Sex Instructional Text**


The control must provide the following definition:


Sex, as recorded at birth or on issue of a full gender recognition certificate


A tooltip display method for instructional text is shown in Figure 4:


Figure 4: Brief Definition of Sex from Control Label (Via a Tooltip)


ISVs need to take responsibility for informing the user about this control by using the following
instructional text in the format appropriate to their application:


Sex is the phenotypic sex of the person as recorded by the Registrar on the Register of Births, or other initial registration,
or on issue of a full gender recognition certificate under the Gender Recognition Act. Valid values are:

 **Male**

 **Female**

 **Not Known**  - used when no information on this subject is known

 **Indeterminate**  - used when the person is unable to be classified as either male or female

##### **2.3.3 Data Values Instructional Text**


In addition to having instructional text for the control label, instructional text for the data values
should be provided. These could be added in a variety of methods, such as a tooltip, as
demonstrated in Figure 5:


Figure 5: Definition of Data Value from Value Label (Via a Tooltip)

##### **2.3.4 Guidance**


CGS-0017 Provide definitions for input controls. Mandatory


CGS-0018 Provide access to definitions of the valid values. Mandatory


CGS-0019 Provide a shortened version of the definitions. Recommended


Table 8: Guidance for Instructional Text

Current Gender is a statement by the individual about the
gender they currently identify themselves to be (that is,
self-assigned). The valid values are:

 Male

 Female

 Other Specific – when the person has a clear idea of

what their gender is, but it is neither discretely male nor
female, for example, 'Intersex', 'transgender', 'third
gender'

 Not Known – used when no information on this subject is

known

 Not Specified – when the person is unable to specify their

current gender or does not have a clear idea of their
current gender


Sex is the phenotypic sex of the person as recorded by the
Registrar on the Register of Births, or other initial
registration, or on issue of a full gender recognition certificate
under the Gender Recognition Act. Valid values are:

 Male

 Female

 Not Known – used when no information on this subject is

known

 Indeterminate – used when the person is unable to be

classified as either male or female



Sex, as recorded at birth or on issue of a full gender
recognition certificate



Use this format to define Current
Gender within a clinical application.


Use this format to define Sex within a
clinical application.



Current Gender, as assigned by the individual to themselves Use this text as a shortened definition of

Current Gender within a clinical
application, especially in cases where
brevity is paramount.



Use this text as a shortened definition of
Sex within a clinical application,
especially in cases where brevity is
paramount, such as in a tooltip design.



Table 9: Correct Examples of Instructional Text for Status Type and Data Value Definitions

##### **2.3.6 Rationale**


Shortened definitions are to be used where the full instructional text is not required or desirable, for
example, when a tooltip is placed on a control label. Whilst tooltips can contain as many as 150
characters, they should ideally contain only a brief description in order to allow the user to read it.
Additionally, certain technologies only allow a restricted amount of data to be contained in them (for
example, the Mozilla [®] Firefox [®] Web browser truncates after about 90 characters).

HSCIC Controlled Document

#### **2.4 Control Layout and Structure**


The input controls should be constructed in a manner that supports only the input of a predefined
set of values. Therefore, both an 'Option Button Group’ (also known as a ‘Radio Button Group’) and
a ‘Drop-down List Box’ design have been considered.


The option button group design is considered to occupy more screen space but provides better
instruction to the user.

##### **2.4.1 Current Gender Option Button Group**


This control will be used when a user needs to enter the Current Gender that the patient has
assigned to themselves. It consists of a group of five standard option buttons within a control group,
as displayed in Figure 6. It should be used whenever the developer has room in their form design.


Figure 6: Current Gender Option Button Design (Focus on Male)


An alternative layout is displayed in Figure 7, which may be desirable when the layout is more
suited to the available screen space:


Figure 7: Inline Option Button Design


_**2.4.1.1**_ _**Guidance**_


CGS-0020 Current Gender option button group input controls must consist of five option buttons. Mandatory

_**2.4.1.4**_ _**Rationale**_


The option button group design is considered to be the safest and most accessible design. It
instantly displays the valid options to the user for them to assess the correct value. The option
buttons are a known medium for selecting a single value from a predefined list and so the user
knows what is expected. Additionally, invalid values cannot be entered and, therefore, that type of
entry error is precluded.


This design minimises user effort by placing the most obvious choices first. The design also has a
default of ‘Not Known’ to encourage users to select an option only when appropriate.


This design uses controls that are recognised by assistive technologies (for example, screen
readers) and allow for easy implementation of instructional text through tooltips.

##### **2.4.2 Sex Option Button Group**


This control will be used when a user needs to enter information about the Sex value that the
patient has assigned to themselves. It consists of a group of four standard option buttons within a
control group, as displayed in Figure 8:


Figure 8: Sex Option Button Design with a Value Selected


This layout should be used whenever the developer has room in their form design. Figure 9
displays the control in its default ‘null’ state (unlike the Current Gender control, which has a default
value):


Figure 9: Sex Option Button Design in Default 'Null' State


An alternative layout is displayed in Figure 10, which may be desirable when the layout is more
suited to the available screen space:

_**2.4.2.4**_ _**Rationale**_



**Data quality**

This example allows a user to select multiple
data values when only one should be
assigned.


**User experience**

This example uses checkboxes, suggesting
to users that multiple selections are
possible.


**Data quality**

This example allows a user to select a value
that is not recognisable to ISB HaSC
standards.


**Data quality**

This example does not allow a user to enter
all the possible valid values for this status.


**Data quality**

This example allows a user to select a data
value that is not valid.


**Data quality**

This example shows a control label that
could be misinterpreted as a Current Gender
status.

The option button group design is considered to be the safest and most accessible design. It
instantly displays the valid options to the user for them to assess the correct value. The option
buttons are a known medium for selecting a single value from a predefined list and so the user
knows what is expected. Additionally, invalid values cannot be entered and, therefore, that type of
entry error is precluded.


This design minimises user effort by placing the most obvious choices first and has a default of null
or blank (for example, “”). Patient Safety Assessments have revealed that this data is too important

to leave in a default value, which could be misinterpreted as actual input. It was felt that if there is a
default value, a user might be encouraged to tab through the input control, without attempting to
select an option. Users will need to interact with a default state input control, in order to select a
valid value. Once this control has a valid value, it will not be possible for a user to set it back to the
default null state.


This design uses controls that are recognised by assistive technologies (for example, screen
readers) and allow for easy implementation of instructional text through tooltips.

##### **2.4.3 Current Gender Drop-Down List Box**


The drop-down list box design is considered desirable for developers who want to save space on a
form or where many drop-down list boxes are already implemented in their design. Figure 11
displays an example of the control in a default state, which is to have ‘Not Known’ selected:

CGS-0025 Current Gender drop-down list box options are in the following order (top to bottom):

1. Male

2. Female

3. Other Specific

4. Not Known

5. Not Specified



Mandatory



CGS-0026 Use a single drop-down list box for the Current Gender control. Mandatory


CGS-0027 Do not use a prompt for the Current Gender control, due to its default value of 'Not Known'. Mandatory

_**2.4.3.4**_ _**Rationale**_


The drop-down list box design increases data quality by allowing users to only enter discrete values
whilst conserving screen space.


This design minimises user effort by placing the most obvious choices first in the list order. The
design also has a default of ‘Not Known’ to encourage users to select an option only when
appropriate.

##### **2.4.4 Sex Drop-Down List Box**


The drop-down list box design is considered desirable for developers who want to save space on a
form or where many drop-down list boxes are already implemented in their design. Figure 13
displays an example of the control in a default state, which is to be in a null state with nothing
selected:

_**2.4.4.1**_ _**Guidance**_



![](sex_assets/sex.pdf-20-0.png)

CGS-0028 Ensure that Sex controls have no value selected by default and no method of returning to this
‘null’ state.



Mandatory



CGS-0029 Use a single control for the Sex drop-down list box. Mandatory


CGS-0030 Ensure that the Sex drop-down list box is blank by default and does not contain a prompt. Recommended
