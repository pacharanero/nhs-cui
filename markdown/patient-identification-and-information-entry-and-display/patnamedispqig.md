**Guidance**

**Introduction**

The unambiguous recording and reading of patient names is vital for patient safety and application usability. Confusion is likely to lead to delays in identification (or, even worse, cause misidentification) of patients and their associated items, such as records and letters.

Therefore, a consistent and clear format for the input and display of patient names is a key component of an effective health care system.

**Important**

Although it contains all of the guidance points, this document omits supporting information and is therefore not intended as a substitute for the full NHS CUI document _Patient Name Input and Display_ **[1]** . Refer to that document for the definitive statement of the design guidance in this area.

The visual representations used to display the guidance are illustrative only. Stylistic choices (for example, display font used), unless otherwise specified, are not part of the guidance and are therefore not mandatory requirements.

### Patient Name Display

This document refers to Patient Name elements using the descriptors 'Family Name' and 'Given Name'. This includes the labels used within the visual representations. However, use of these terms is not Mandatory but only Recommended (see **Instructional Text** section). An example of alternative terms would be 'Last Name' and 'First Name'.
