#### **Guidance** **Introduction**

The NHS categorises a person’s gender in two ways:


  - **Person Gender Current**, which refers to a person’s current gender classification


For brevity and clarity, this document uses the term **Current Gender** for this concept


  - **Person Gender at Registration**, which refers to the record of a person’s gender
classification at the point of birth registration


For brevity and clarity, this document uses the term **Sex** for this concept


Healthcare professionals and patients may confuse the terms ‘Current Gender’ and ‘Sex’,
or assume that they are synonymous. Therefore, all NHS applications should display and
explain those terms in a clear and consistent manner, both at input and at subsequent
display.


Allowable values for Current Gender and Sex need to be from a pre-defined, restricted set
in order to ensure legal compliance and data interoperability and to respect patient
sensitivity.


**Important**


The values defined in this document are based upon the current proposed changes to
the _NHS Data Model and Dictionary_ **[1]** . Should future changes be made to this
document, amendments to this guidance will be required.


Although it contains all of the guidance points, this document omits supporting
information and is therefore not intended as a substitute for the full NHS CUI document
_Sex and Current Gender Input and Display_ **[2]** . Refer to that document for the definitive
statement of the design guidance in this area.


The visual representations used to display the guidance are illustrative only. Stylistic
choices (for example, display font used), unless otherwise specified, are not part of the
guidance and are therefore not mandatory requirements.

### **Current Gender and Sex Input**

The guidance supports two control styles for input of Current Gender and Sex



**Option Button Group**
(also known as Radio Button Group)


Current Gender



**Drop-Down List Box**

|---|---|

|Male<br>Female<br>Not Known<br>Indeterminate|Male<br>Female<br>Not Known<br>Indeterminate|



The Option Button group design
occupies more screen space but
provides better instruction to the user.


This control style should be used if
there is room on the input form.
