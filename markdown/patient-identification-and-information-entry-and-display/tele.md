**Patient Safety Process**


The development lifecycle for this design guide includes an integrated patient / clinical safety risk
assessment and management process.


Known patient safety incidents relevant to this design guidance area have been researched and
reviewed as part of ongoing development. The resulting guidance points aim to support mitigation
of these known patient safety risks. In addition, the developers of this design guide have
undertaken a patient safety risk assessment to identify new risks that could potentially be
introduced by the guidance points in this document. Any potential risks identified have been
assessed and managed to support the ongoing clinical safety case for this design guide.


The Hazard Log records all the risks that have been identified during development and describes
mitigatory actions that, in some cases, will need to be taken by users of this design guide. The
Hazard Log is a live document that is updated as the design guide is developed and maintained.
Until this design guide has received full Clinical Authority to Release (CATR) from the NHS
Connecting for Health (CFH) Clinical Safety Group (CSG) – based on an approved Clinical Safety
Case – there may be outstanding patient safety risks yet to be identified and mitigated.


Additionally, users implementing applications that follow this design guide’s guidelines (for
example, healthcare system suppliers) are expected to undertake further clinical safety risk
assessments of their specific systems within their specific context of use.


[Refer to www.cui.nhs.uk](https://emea.mail.microsoft.com/OWA/redir.aspx?C=2aab7991b0924c8f92c4e2824ab8a971&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cui.nhs.uk) for further information on the patient safety process and for the safety
status and any relevant accompanying safety documentation for this design guide.

### 1 INTRODUCTION


This document describes the design guidance for the display and input of ‘Telephone number’ data.
It describes the area of focus, provides guidance and recommendations, and explains the rationale
behind the guidance and recommendations.


This document is intended for the use of anyone whose role includes screen design,
implementation, or assessment of a National Health Service (NHS) clinical application. This
document can be used as guidance for the:


 Specification of an input and display control for Telephone data in a user interface (UI)


 Implementation of an input and display control for Telephone data within an application


 Assessment of an input and display control for Telephone data in an NHS clinical

application user interface


Figure 1 shows an example of a guidance-compliant ‘Single Text Entry Box’ designed to assist in
UK-based telephone number input. Figure 2 shows an example of a text entry box combined with a
‘Country Selector’, which is guidance-compliant for non-UK-based telephone number input.


Figure 1: Single Text Entry Box


Figure 2: Country Selector Assisted Text Entry Box


**Note**


Elements used within a software application are commonly referred to as a ‘control’. These can take many
forms but the types referred to in this document will either be ‘input controls’ that can receive input from a
user, such as a button, text box, option button (radio button) or check box, or ‘display controls’ such as a
label, which can only display information.


Table 1 describes the changes made since the previous version of this guidance (Baseline version
3.0.0.0 dated 25 June 2009):


**Deleted** Brackets around area codes (throughout document)


**Amended** Text within paragraphs to reflect removal of brackets (throughout document)


**Added** Incorrect usage example (section 2.2.1.5)


Table 1: Changes Since the Last Baseline Version

#### **1.1 Customer Need**


This section explains why this guidance has been created.

##### **1.1.1 Overview**


Telephone numbers display in various contexts within an NHS application, many of which are
displayed within a clinical system. As such, it is an important requirement for both patient safety
and general usability that each number can be easily recognised as unique, in order to reduce
errors and increase efficiency. By assisting the user when inputting telephone numbers, errors are
reduced and data quality is increased.

##### **1.1.2 Eliminating Inconsistencies Across Systems**


Significant inconsistencies exist across the labelling, inputting, and displaying of telephone
numbers across various clinical applications. With clinical users often switching between
applications, these inconsistencies can lead to the incorrect identification of patients, which in turn,
leads to safety issues. Reduction of inconsistency is therefore an important goal in itself and the
primary aim of this guidance.

##### **1.1.3 Simplified User Interface Design and Development**


Having a consistent layout and set of values for the input and display of data items in clinical
systems potentially makes the design and development of such systems safer, easier, and quicker.

#### **1.2 Scope**


This section defines the scope of this guidance document.

##### **1.2.1 In Scope**


This guidance is applicable primarily to electronic user interfaces such as those displayed on
desktop and laptop computers. However, many of the principles can also be applied to paper form
design, should it be required. The following items are in scope:


 **Defining the valid values for Telephone display and input**


 **Control layout and structure, in order to achieve:**


 Optimal visibility of the values

 Easy recognition of the values in the context of the wider clinical application


 Easy recognition of data type requested for input


 Reduction of invalid entries

 Optimal size of input fields

##### **1.2.2 Out of Scope**


This section defines areas that are not covered in this guidance. Although there may be specific
risks associated with these areas that are not addressed in this guidance, it is likely that the
principles in this guidance will extend to the aspects of the input and display of telephone numbers
in many of the areas listed below.


The following items are out of scope:


 **Data storage**  - This guidance does not prescribe the format for storing data that is input or

displayed


 **Terms of use**  - This guidance does not define when an input field or display should be

presented within a system


 **Form design**  - This guidance does not prescribe the correct layout for a form or the

navigation around a form


 **Fax numbers**  - This guidance does not prescribe the format for fax numbers


 **Data input control types**  - This document does not specify how the input controls should

be labelled, for example, ‘Home number’ or ‘Preferred contact’. The concept of types and
context are not explicitly supported. However, the flexible behaviour of the input control and
the exclusion of a control-level label enable the developer to reuse the same input control
for multiple situations. Figure 3 displays an example of the controls used for multiple ‘types’
of telephone data:

**Note**


Listing an item as out of scope does not classify it as unimportant. Project time and resource constraints
inevitably restrict what can be in scope for a particular release. It is possible that items out of scope for
this release may be considered for a future release.

#### **1.3 Dependencies and Assumptions**


Compliance with other guidance is required as follows:


 The design of NHS clinical applications must conform to _Accessibility Checkpoints for NHS_

_Clinical Applications_ **{R1}** and _Accessibility for Clinical Applications_ **{R2}**


**Important**


The visual representations used within this document to display the guidance are illustrative only. Stylistic
choices are not part of the guidance and are therefore not mandatory requirements for compliance with
the guidance in this document.

#### **1.4 Key Principles**


The following key principles have shaped the guidance in this document:


 Display information according to existing standards


 Minimise opportunities for human error


 Display sufficient instructional information to support data quality


 Promote consistency across the mix of users, NHS clinical applications and care settings


 Ensure reliable and accurate identification of an individual patient record


 Minimise opportunities where patient-clinician relationships may be compromised

### 2 RECOMMENDATIONS AND GUIDANCE


The guidance provided throughout this document is based upon a programme of user research,
including:


 Previous background research for this design specification, which reviewed the standards

of the following organisations:


 UK Government Office of Communications (Ofcom)


 UK Government Data Standards

 Microsoft [®] Corporation

 IBM [®] Corporation

 Dell [®]


 A desk-based research project looking at a range of information entry Web pages and

clinical applications


 A Web-based survey of 41 respondents from NHS clinicians and administrative staff,

Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), community pharmacists, and NHS Connecting for
Health (CFH)


 A Patient Safety Assessment


**Important**


The visual representations used within this document to display the guidance are illustrative only. They
are simplified in order to support understanding of the guidance points. Stylistic choices, such as colours,
fonts or icons are not part of the guidance and unless otherwise specified are not mandatory requirements
for compliance with the guidance in this document.

#### **2.1 Telephone Number Display**


This section defines the recommendations for displaying telephone numbers in NHS clinical
applications. NHS clinical applications should display telephone numbers in this format to facilitate
contact by telephone with patients, clinicians, hospitals or surgeries.


The chosen layout provides the best display format because it shows a complete, unambiguous
presentation of telephone contact details, which includes all information and clearly identifies
optional digits.


**Note**


It is recognised that most telephone numbers stored within NHS clinical applications will relate to UK
locations. In these cases, the international code element is not required.


Telephone numbers in NHS clinical applications can comprise up to four elements, are separated
by spaces and are displayed in the following order:


 **International Code (optional)**  - Is represented by a plus (+) symbol followed by the

relevant numeric country code (which will be between two and four digits)


 **Area Code (mandatory)**  - The entire area code (including optional digits such as a leading

zero) must not be enclosed within brackets. This code is usually a sequence of between
three and six digits. Where the international code is displayed, optional digits within the
area code should be omitted


**Note**


Page 4

HSCIC Controlled Document


Ofcom holds responsibility for UK telecommunications. Ofcom manages the UK telephone
numbering plan, including area codes, and this may change from time to time.


 **Local Number (mandatory)**  - If the local number (typically a sequence of between four

and eight digits) contains more than six digits, then a single space should precede the final
four digits


 **Extension Number (optional)**  - Is validly represented by either:


 A single input box including an ‘x’ character displayed directly after the telephone
number followed by a numeric extension code (typically four digits in length)


The full telephone number then displays as:


+ _International Code Area Code_ _Local Number_ x _Extension Number_


 Display in a separate extension input box adjacent to the telephone number input box


The full telephone number then displays as:


+ _International Code_ _Area Code_ _Local Number_ [Extension _Extension Number_ ]


Figure 4 shows an example of the recommended telephone number format:

Table 4: Incorrect Telephone Number Formatting Examples

##### **2.1.4 Rationale**


The use of spaces aids readability by logically grouping the digits into meaningful categories. The
recommended grouping follows commonly-used conventions and thus aids recognisability for the
user.


_**2.1.4.1**_ _**Accessibility**_


The inclusion of the international and area codes assists with the unique recognition of telephone
number formats from other countries. The plus sign provide a clear indication that the value
represents an international telephone number. This is important because the length of each
element of a telephone number element may vary.


An inherent problem with screen reader software is that the form that numbers take when read out
is dependent on the numbers themselves. Examples of spoken telephone numbers include:


 **01632 960154** dictated as “zero sixteen thirty two nine hundred sixty thousand one hundred

fifty four”


It is unfortunate that the audible reading patterns differ according to the specific number. However,
this is considered acceptable because screen reader users are accustomed to dealing with such
numbers.


_**2.1.4.2**_ _**Patient Safety**_


A Telephone number display affects patient safety when it appears in close proximity to the NHS
Number within a screen. In such cases, the numbers could be confused, resulting in the user
accessing the wrong patient record details. Therefore, the format of each number should provide a
clear distinction between the relevant value types. This is illustrated in Figure 5:


Figure 5: Example of a Telephone Number Format in Close Proximity to an NHS Number


NHS numbers should display as groups of digits, separated by single spaces. Telephone numbers
should exhibit formats that clearly distinguish them from associated NHS numbers. This can be
achieved easily by preceding the optional international code with a plus sign (‘+’).

![](tele_assets/tele.pdf-10-2.png)
HSCIC Controlled Document


_**2.1.4.3**_ _**Clinical Utility**_


A user should view telephone number information in a consistent format, with a recognisable
reading pattern. This format ensures a clear distinction between the constituent elements.


One of the main considerations for users is whether to display the international code. If it is
displayed in all instances, there will never be a need to look up secondary sources for extra dialling
codes. However, most telephone numbers stored within NHS clinical applications will relate to UK
locations, in which case the international code element is redundant.


For consistency, certainty and the avoidance of ambiguity, applications should implement a single
format for all telephone numbers. It is also beneficial to use a display format that clearly
distinguishes telephone numbers from other numerical information, such as dates and NHS
numbers.


_**2.1.4.4**_ _**Display Space**_


Telephone numbers display in various contexts within an NHS application. From an application
developer’s perspective, an important consideration is display space. Telephone numbers can have
variable lengths, potentially extending up to 20 digits with the international code. Separators
increase the overall length.

#### **2.2 Telephone Number Input**


The purpose of the telephone number input control is to allow the user to enter a telephone
number. The input control has two states: a single unassisted entry input box (primarily used for UK
telephone number entry), as displayed in Figure 6, and a single entry box with country selector
assistance (primarily used for non-UK telephone numbers), as displayed in Figure 7.


Figure 6: Single Text Entry Box


Figure 7: Country Selector Assisted Text Entry Box


These two different states have been designed for the specific purpose of making different number
types easy to enter. The Single Text Entry Box encourages convenient entry of UK-based
numbers, and the Country Selector Assisted Entry Box assists the user in the convenient entry of
non-UK-based numbers. However, both designs will accept and correctly identify both UK and
non-UK numbers.

##### **2.2.1 Unassisted Design**


The ‘unassisted’ single text entry box for UK telephone entry is a freeform text entry box that:


 Uses rules to identify number formats


 Removes extraneous characters from the input


 Displays clean data in a safe and distinct format


Page 8


Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre


HSCIC Controlled Document


The size of the single text entry box is related to how the text is displayed in the interface. The size,
weight, style and type of font used all affect how much space is required to display the right amount
of information. The requirement is for the input box to display over 95% of the expected input
values 100% of the time. It is therefore preferable to specify the size of input boxes in relation to
character strings:


 **Default** length to accommodate the following example prompt text: 020 1234 5678 x1234


 **Minimum** length to accommodate the following example prompt text: 01234 567890


 **Maximum** length is not constrained


The rules surrounding how the telephone number input box behaves is detailed in the document
entitled _CFH NPFIT CSA – Telecommunication Address Display Requirements for CSA_ **{R3}** .
However, the NHS CUI Programme has the additional requirement to handle extension numbers
upon display.


The basic principles below should be followed:


 The Input box should accept formatted and unformatted entries


 If the number can be identified as a valid type (as per the rules in _CFH NPFIT CSA –_

_Telecommunication Address Display Requirements for CSA_ **{R3}** ), the input box should
strip out formatting upon losing focus, and replace it with a reformatted equivalent which:


 Places spaces in logical locations for readability purposes


 If the number cannot be identified as a valid type (as per the rules in _CFH NPFIT CSA –_

_Telecommunication Address Display Requirements for CSA_ **{R3}** ) then:


 The input box leaves the entry as it was entered


 The input box displays the entry to the user as it was entered


 The UK country code can be entered but is removed from display after it has been

committed


 All other country codes are retained (as detailed in APPENDIX A.)


A number of different use cases are displayed from Figure 8 to Figure 15:

A separate input box for the area code can cause
users to incorrectly guess the area code.


####  Brackets are shown around the area code on a

formatted number.


Table 7: Incorrect Examples of Unassisted Telephone Number Input


_**2.2.1.6**_ _**Rationale**_


The inconsistent length of area codes in the UK can cause users to make errors when they are
asked to distinguish the area code from the rest of the telephone number. Therefore, a single entry
text box is the safest and most effective design.

##### **2.2.2 Assisted Design**


This control prepends a country selector to the single text input box. The country selector assists
the user in selecting the correct dialling code for non-UK telephone numbers, by presenting the
user with a list box of known dialling codes, at the time of creation.


The addition of the country selector increases the screen space required by the input control and is
not seen as a regular usage case. As such, it is not envisaged as the default input control. The
primary use case for this control is as a secondary level of input after the user has stated that they
will be inputting a non-UK number.

The country selector is shown in Figure 16 and appears expanded in the context of a full input
control in Figure 17.

The country selector should have the following properties:


 **Default** length to accommodate the following example prompt text: "+376 (AD)"


 **Minimum** length to accommodate the following example prompt text: “+376 (AD)”


 **Maximum** length is not constrained


_**2.2.2.1**_ _**Guidance**_


TID-0020 Use a default value of +44 (UK) for the country code. Mandatory



TID-0021 Use the ISO 3166 names in the first column, the Ofcom list of dialling codes in the second
column and the ISO 3166 abbreviated country codes in the third column. Use the abbreviation
‘UK’ instead of the ISO 3166 code of ‘GB’.


TID-0022 Order the country names alphabetically.

Include United Kingdom once at the top of the list and once in its appropriate alphabetical
location.



Mandatory


Mandatory



TID-0023 Use an editable drop-down list for country codes. Recommended


TID-0024 Allow the country codes to be navigated using free-text entry. Recommended



TID-0025 Populate the country selector list with the three elements below and in this exact order:

1. Country name (left-aligned and vertically aligned to all rows).

2. Country dialling code (right-aligned using the '+' format, for example, ‘+44').

3. Country abbreviation (right-aligned, two-character code, enclosed in single brackets and

vertically aligned to all rows).

The user is only required to interact with the
country selector if it is a non-UK number.


A drop-down list of all the valid values assists the
user in correctly identifying the number they
need.


Alphabetising the country selector list assists the
user in finding the data they require. Because
‘UK’ is expected to be the primary selection of
users, it is duplicated for convenience.

####  Use of separate

Table 10: Incorrect Examples of Assisted Telephone Number Input


_**2.2.2.4**_ _**Rationale**_



The use of separate input boxes increases
screen clutter and the likelihood of input error.


The button input design does not suggest to the
user that they can type a selection here. It does
not display the numerical country code and so
increases the likelihood of a user committing a
duplication error by inputting the country code in
the second input box. Finally, the user cannot
check the full numerical number because they
cannot see the country code.



The country selector assists the user in the input of foreign numbers. If the user does not know the
required country code, they can select it from the alphabetised list. If they do know the country
code, they can input it directly as the input box is editable.


A large majority of cases will require a UK selection and therefore, this is both the default and the
first item on the list. A duplicate entry for the UK is in the logical location in the subsequent
alphabetised list, which ensures the user finds what they are searching for.


_**2.2.2.5**_ _**Text Input Box**_


The second field in the ‘assisted’ design, displayed with the title **Telephone Number** in Figure 17,
is the same as the single text entry box in section 2.2.1.

### APPENDIX A TELEPHONE NUMBER RULES


**Important**


For the purposes of clarity, it is important to emphasise that this Appendix is concerned only with the
display of telephone numbers. The format for telephone number storage or transmission is out of scope
for this design guidance. It is assumed that the application developer implements a suitable mechanism to
process the formats used in the target environment. This mechanism must ensure that the resulting
display of telephone numbers conforms to the guidelines in this document.

#### **PART I CSA Rules For Telephone Number Element Identification**


This section displays the list of rules defined by the Clinical Spine Application (CSA) for identifying
the elements within a telephone number. These can be found in _CFH NPFIT CSA –_
_Telecommunication Address Display Requirements for CSA_ **{R3}** .


1. If the value starts with a plus sign (+) or ‘00’, then apply International Number Prefix Rules **–**

**go to step 3** .


2. Otherwise apply UK Telephone Number Representation Rules **– go to step 11** .


The following numbered list describes the International Number Prefix Rules in the order they
should be applied.


3. If the value starts with ‘+44’, and the following digit is not ‘0’, then replace ‘+44’ with ‘0’ and

apply the UK Telephone Number Representation Rules **– go to step 11** .


4. If the value starts with ‘0044’, and the following digit is not ‘0’, then replace ‘0044’ with ‘0’;

apply the UK Telephone Number Representation Rules **– go to step 11** .


5. If the value starts with ‘+’, then apply the following International Number Representation

Rules **– go to step 8** .


6. If the value starts with ‘00’, then replace ‘00’ with ‘+’ and apply the following International

Number Representation Rules **– go to step 8** .


7. If the value starts with ‘+44’ or ‘0044’ and the following digit is ‘0’, then (this is invalid)

display the entire value as received **– end** .


The following numbered list describes the International Number Representation Rules in the
order they should be applied.


8. Add a space after the international dialling code element using the international standard

[available at http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/inr/codes.html.](http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/inr/codes.html)


9. Remove any immediately following separator character.


10.


a. If the remainder contains any non-numeric characters other than valid separator

characters, then display the remainder of the value as received **– end** .


b. Otherwise:


i. If the remainder contains any valid separator characters, then replace each
separator character with a space **– end** .


ii. Else, introduce spaces preceding every four characters, from the right, so that there

are never more than 6 characters without a break, and never fewer than 3
characters in a group **– end** .

The following numbered list describes the UK Telephone Number Representation Rules in the
order they should be applied.


11.


a. If the value contains any non-numeric characters other than valid separator characters,

then display the value without further transformation **– end**


b. Otherwise, if the value contains valid separator characters, then remove the separator

characters and apply the transformation rules as specified in the following sections.


12. If the numeric value begins with ‘01’ or ‘02’, then test these geographic area number

representation rules in the following order. Only apply one rule.


a. If the code starts ‘02’, then insert a space after the 3rd digit.


b. If the code has a ‘1’ in the 3rd or 4th position, then insert a space after the 4th digit.


c. If the first 6 digits match any of the following 11 codes, then insert a space after the 6th

digit. 013873 Langholm; 015242 Hornby; 015394 Hawkshead; 015395 Grange-OverSands; 015396 Sedbergh; 016973 Wigton; 016974 Raughton Head; 017683 Appleby;
017684 Pooley Bridge; 017687 Keswick; 019467 Gosforth.


d. For all other codes, insert the space after the 5th digit.


13. Having applied the above rules, if the remainder of the number, following the space,

contains more than 6 digits, then introduce a space preceding the final four digits.


14. If the numeric value begins with ‘07’ or ‘05’ or ‘03’ or ‘04’ or ‘06’, then follow these number

representation rules:


a. Add a space after the first 5 digits (including the initial 0).


b. If the remainder contains more than 6 digits, then introduce a space preceding the final

four digits.


15. If the numeric value begins with ‘08’ or ‘09’, then follow these special services number

representation rules:


a. Add a space after the first 4 digits (including the initial 0).


b. If the remainder contains more than 6 digits, then introduce a space preceding the final

four digits.


16. If the numeric value does not begin with ‘0’, then display the value without further

transformation **– end** .

#### **PART II Example Additional Rules Handling Extension Numbers**


This section lists the extra rules that are required to identify and display extension numbers. These
rules are additional to, and would need to be applied before, those defined in _CFH NPFIT CSA –_
_Telecommunication Address Display Requirements for CSA_ **{R3}** .


1. Identify if the number has any of the following characters or sequence of characters in it,

followed by a sequence of digits:


 ‘x’


 ‘ex’


 ‘ext’


 ‘extn’


 ‘extension’


 ‘extension number’


 Any of the above, followed by:
 ‘.’
 ‘:’
 ‘=’
 ‘-‘


2. If so, then remove the identified characters and replace with an ‘x’.


3. Then remove the ‘x’ with any subsequent digits and only replace them at the end of the

telephone number after all of the _CFH NPFIT CSA – Telecommunication Address Display_
_Requirements for CSA_ **{R3}** rules have been applied to the remaining telephone number.
