This document presents an introduction into the guidance and recommendations for aspects of Terminology user interfaces related to models of Disambiguation and Error Correction.

This document should be read in conjunction with the following Design Guide documentation:

  - DG-R3-004 Design Guide Entry - Terminology - Searching

  - DG-R3-004 Design Guide Entry - Terminology - Elaboration

  - DG-R3-004 Design Guide Entry - Terminology - Display Standards for Coded Information

  - DG-R3-004 Design Guide Entry - Terminology - Post Coordination

  - DG-R3-004 Terminology Requirements

  - CFH_CUI_HAZARD_LOG_TERMINOLOGY_R3

Please ensure you also read the following Design Guide documentation:

  - Accessibility for Clinical Applications {R2}

Note

This document provides a brief introduction for the Design Guide Entry for Terminology UI Interaction Models of Disambiguation and Error Correction. The detailed guidance is provided in context within the other four Terminology Design Guide Entry documents that are listed above. Please refer to the relevant document for the error correction and disambiguation guidance that you require.

### 1.1 Overview

This document is for the use of anyone whose role includes screen design, implementation or assessment of a NHS clinical application and is involved in creating or evaluating terminology user interfaces.

Terminology user interfaces operate within a note-taking environment. These environments fall into three categories (as illustrated in Figure 1 and described below), each of which require different guidance:

  - Forms

    - The user makes notes by ticking boxes and choosing options, not by entering text

    - An encoding interface is not needed – the clinical codes should be embedded within the
form itself

  - Code and elaborate

    - The user makes notes by selecting a clinical code (such as 'asthma'), and elaborating it
with other codes (such as 'severe') and unencoded text (such as 'mother anxious')

    - Encoding interfaces require components to search for and elaborate clinical terms

 - Free text parser

   - The user makes notes by writing text, then identifies and encodes words and phases within
that text

   - Encoding interfaces require components to identify and manage clinical terms within the
text, as well as components to search for, and elaborate, clinical terms

Figure 1: Styles of Encoding

Medical language is full of abbreviations and jargon, some of which have more than one meaning. By encoding clinical statements, they can be shared unambiguously. This should improve patient safety by reducing confusion, or errors, due to ambiguity in clinical notes.

Encoding also opens up important opportunities, such as:

 - Unambiguously sharing clinical statements between clinicians in different disciplines or
institutions

 - Using decision support mechanisms, based on codes within clinical statements, to enhance
patient safety

 - Auditing clinical activity by using codes to locate and report on specific types of information
within patient records

 - Researching clinical practice or outcomes in the NHS by extracting codes from electronic
patient records

NHS CFH has chosen SNOMED-CT as the terminology for encoding clinical statements.
