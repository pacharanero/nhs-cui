### Executive Summary
**Problem**
  - Clinicians need only some of the clinical data entry structures (‘templates’) available to them in any
given situation
  - Clinicians risk missing the correct template, opening the wrong template or eschewing data structures
and entering free text
**Scope**
  - Assist the clinician accessing and then entering data into the relevant template in a safe, efficient and
timely manner
  - Focus upon the entry of an acute medical admissions form implied by the relevant headings defined by
the Royal College of Physicians
**Headline Findings**
  - To afford the clinician sufficient flexibility during admissions clerking, searching as well as browsing
must be considered in noting using templates
  - The UI may proactively offer templates (either by following the concept encoding or by matching terms
within free text)
  - The UI must be able to accommodate repeated use of certain data fields within the same template

### Problem Statement
**Background**
Traditionally, secondary care clinicians have recorded notes directly on paper or dictated to an assistant. With the advent of electronic noting, clinicians increasingly need to record structured data using electronic systems, in order that the data can be safely accessed, displayed and queried.
**The Problems**
   - In free text, a lot of meaning can be conveyed (and implied) by a small number of characters.
Conversely, a lot of data fields may be required in order to capture the same meaning in structured data entry. This is particularly true of acute medical admission clerking, where, despite following standard high level topic areas, there could be much variation in the details captured. The UI must provide access to all these data fields
   - In natural language, the structures are stored and accessed in the user’s mind, whereas in
structured data entry, the UI needs to offer access to many data permutations. In effect, the onus for navigating and selecting entry components is shifted from the clinician’s mind, where most of the considerations are subconscious, to the UI, where the UI needs to offer options and the clinician needs to choose from them. This potentially introduces a big time penalty for capturing structured data
### Problem Statement
**The Problems (continued)**
   - Previous NHS CUI usability tests have shown that clinicians perceive electronic forms which
have been literally translated from paper to be unwieldy to use in the context of admissions clerking
   - Previous NHS CUI usability tests have shown that clinicians’ natural inclination is to type in a
string of words when noting
   - A form in which the data fields are arranged in a fixed order is not conducive to noting in
which different topics may be addressed in a number of different orders, depending upon factors such as the patient’s specific health problems and needs, the way in which the patient relays their history, and the noting style of the individual clinician. A traditional form design does not afford such flexibility
### Scope Statement
##### • Basic searching • Section search • Additional template search • Search on abbreviations • SNOMED CT® search trigger • Free text trigger • Browsing • Revisiting and adding templates • Reordering
### Items Out of Scope
##### • Patient-specific decision support • Special data previewing functions • Any display of data beyond its initial entry • Printing of forms • Workflow management • Saving data • Actual form design (such as field layout)
### Background to design consultation
This design exploration is based upon the notion that data structure has been defined in the form of data ‘templates’, that is, fixed configurations of data fields, some of which are constrained by the values that can be entered. Templates have a number of different meanings, not least in the health informatics field, but the term is used in a general way in this consultation.
In graphical user interface terms, the most conventional manifestation of templates would be as ‘forms’, where the data fields are presented to the user, typically as a set of boxes into which the user can type or select data. They could be manifested in other ways, such as constraining matches in a text parsing context, but typically they are presented as forms.
Forms may comprise sections and subsections, all of which contain fields. In this consultation document, we assume that any section or subsection is a template in its own right. That is to say, templates can be nested.
Although ‘template’ refers to a standalone unit of data structure, in the wider noting context we are not assuming that any template can be used in isolation. A form may comprise a number of sections, each of which constitutes a template, and these templates may be accessed as individual units within the context of the form. However, it does not follow that clinicians can access sections outside of the context of the form in which they belong.
### Patient Safety Process
The development lifecycle for this consultation document includes an integrated patient safety assessment and management process.
Known patient safety incidents relevant to this area have been researched and reviewed as part of ongoing development.
The Hazard Log records all the risks that have been identified during development and describes potential mitigatory actions that could be considered alongside future exploratory work in this area. The Hazard Log is a live document that will be updated as this area of work is developed further.
Until this work is progressed and developed to full design guide status it will not be in a position to achieve full Clinical Authority to Release (CATR) from the NHS Connecting for Health (CFH) Clinical Safety Group (CSG).
[Please refer to NHS Common User Interface for further information on the patient safety process](http://www.cui.nhs.uk/Pages/NHSCommonUserInterface.aspx) and for the safety status and any relevant accompanying safety documentation for this consultation document.
### About this design consultation
The purpose of the document is to summarize the current learning that has been achieved in the design and research process to date. This is articulated primarily in terms of the features that comprise the preferred current design. These design features aggregate into nine themes.
For each theme we summarise the key design points, plus the rationale for choosing these points. We then illustrate these with images of the current design, plus an indication of some of the alternatives we have been considering. We end each theme by outlining the proposed next steps and future exploration.
### Assumptions
 - Aspects of care can be documented within standalone data templates which can
be assembled to form a coherent patient record
 - The UI should encourage the user to complete a template rather than entering
free text, where appropriate templates exist
 - The UI will offer multiple routes for opening structured data templates:
    - Providing a means to browse the template
    - Providing a means to search for sections within the template
    - Allowing the clinician to open the whole template in a single action
    - Suggesting possible templates based upon terms that the clinician has entered
 - Appropriate search engine technology is available to support the searching
outlined in this consultation
 - Appropriate authorities will manage the creation of and access to appropriate
clinical templates
 - SNOMED CT is the chosen terminology in the NHS
 - The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) guidelines on acute medical admissions
clerking provide the standard high level structure for an admission template
### Brief outline of the themes
This design consultation is addressing several solutions which address the problem of accessing the appropriate template from within a large set of templates. These solutions are intended to be mutually compatible.
The **Basic searching** design topic addresses how clinicians can search for templates. It provides the foundation for the rest of the searching designs, which in turn address specific searching needs.
The **Section search**, which also includes the **Additional template search** and **Search on** **abbreviations** topics, is a particular type of search where the clinician can search for section headings within a form, in addition to finding additional templates.
Another way in which the clinician can access sections within the form is by **Browsing**, for example via a tree structure.
In addition to allowing the clinician to search for templates, the designs also address how the UI can proactively suggest templates based upon terms that the clinician has entered, either via a **SNOMED CT search trigger** or via a **Free text trigger** .
Finally, the design addresses some auxiliary features. It covers what happens if the clinician decides to revisit a template via the search or browse functions, and how the clinician can add more of the same fields ( **Revisiting and Adding templates** ). It also deals with how the clinician may reorder the sections according to a standard sequence ( **Reordering)** .

## THEME 1 – BASIC SEARCHING
### 1.1 Introduction to Basic Searching

This theme explores the necessary features required to provide the clinician with a means for searching for and opening clinical templates, primarily manifested as forms, of varying sizes, but also as section headings within forms.

Such a function would be intended to be used in a number of situations, including at the start of clerking a patient and in those contexts where the clinician is already entering notes and needs an additional template.

The designs in this theme explore the basic UI features that will comprise such a search function, including:

 - How to allow clinicians to type in the (criteria) search text

 - How to display the results

 - How to filter the results, including displaying the current filter

 - How to display relevant metadata

 - How to search on metadata, such as structure (for example, section headings) within the form

 - How to browse between and within search results

|Design point|Rationale key points|
|---|---|
|The results are filtered according to context:<br>•<br>For example, by a local filter which could account for<br>the clinician’s specialty, division or department<br>•<br>For example, by the specific stage in the patient’s<br>treatment|There is a risk of the clinician choosing a template out of context,<br>unless filtering is applied. Completing the wrong template could<br>adversely affect future interpretations of the patient’s health (PSA)<br>(UX)<br> <br>The concept of filtering was supported by the clinicians tested (UR)|
|The filtering includes rather than excludes<br>generic templates|Generic templates, such as a general medical admission form, may<br>be missed if filtering means that only domain-specific templates are<br>selected (UR)|
|The current filter label is displayed as part<br>of the filter adjustment control|User research indicated the importance of clearly communicating<br>the current filter, plus a control for adjusting (for example, breaking<br>out of) the filter (UR)|
|The results are ordered by phrase similarity|Research within other areas of CUI have revealed that clinicians<br>understand ordering by phrase similarity (CUI)|
|The list only displays a maximum number of<br>results by default:<br>•<br>Meanwhile a widget is provided which reveals more<br>results|Depending upon the search criteria, the search could return any<br>number of results. The space available will necessarily limit the<br>number of results that can be displayed simultaneously. Also,<br>showing more than several at a time can reduce the user's ability to<br>find what they need. Therefore, although the search could return<br>any number of results, only a set number are shown in the initial<br>view(CF)|

### 1.4 Next steps

  - Validate assumptions around the availability of templates, including understanding
what templates could be available according to the Logical Record Architecture roadmap

  - Explore and refine guidance around search logic. Further define the high level rules

  - Test the usability of the filter function and confirm assumptions around what contextual
information can be used automatically by the UI

  - Evaluate the use of the template search function within the context of the acute
medical admission clerking. In the current designs, this function is featured in the righthand panel. Further testing is required to understand its potential use in relation to the other search and match features offered by the design

  - Further explore the concept of browsing within search results. This was deemed to be
worthy of further exploration by the user research

Slide 27 18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre

### 1.4 Future exploration

  - Explore the utility and feasibility of searching on fields and possible field values within
templates (for example, search on ‘stridor’, which is a possible selection value rather than a field or section)

  - Validate the use of metadata. Given its potential utility, assess how feasible the
creation and maintenance of such data would be in future

  - Explore the management of suggested and/or prioritised templates

  - Explore the interaction between this feature and wider knowledge and decision
support mechanisms

## THEME 2 – SECTION SEARCH

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 29

### 2.1 Introduction to Section Search

This theme tackles a problem with offering someone a large template, namely the time taken to navigate around it to find the section and fields that one needs, in the order in which one needs them.

One solution is to provide a visual browsing mechanism (such as a tree). However, another solution is to provide a search function that allows the clinician to search for sections and subsections within the template. In this way, it starts to replicate the clinician’s current noting behaviour: namely entering a heading and then entering notes below it.

![](usingtemplates_assets/usingtemplates.pdf-29-0.png)

![](usingtemplates_assets/usingtemplates.pdf-29-1.png)

The designs in this theme assume an initial situation where the clinician has opened the admissions noting page and it is blank (or possibly there are one or two default sections already there, such as ‘Presenting Complaint(s)’).

It addresses how clinicians can add and complete sections of the acute medical admissions form to the noting page incrementally, by typing in search text.

It builds on the designs explored in the Basic searching exploration.

## THEME 3 – ADDITIONAL TEMPLATE SEARCH

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 38

### 3.1 Introduction to Additional Template Search

There may be points within the admission clerking process where the clinician needs to access additional templates, such as a score or a risk calculator. In this respect, templates built for medical admission clerking tend to be wide-reaching, but not exhaustive. We predict that a proportion of the noting will require templates which do not belong to the core template.

However, we assume that clinicians will not necessarily know which data structures belong within the core template and which are additional templates. Therefore, the designs assume that additional templates can be accessed in the same way as the core sections.

Nevertheless, the additional templates will open outside of the core admission template, and therefore, to avoid confusion, the clinician should be aware that there is a distinction between core and additional templates. Therefore, the designs:

 - Show how the clinician can access additional templates during admission clerking

 - Show how to display additional templates results in the (section) search feature

 - Distinguish core from additional templates

form) and additional templates. Should the templates feature visible linkages, and, if so, how?

  - Explore if additional templates can safely be inserted into a given form

  - Explore if there are circumstances where additional templates could replace sections
within the acute admissions form (for example, if the patient has a need for a specialist examination). How would these be inserted into the form? Should they then be represented within the browseable tree structure?

## THEME 4 – SEARCHING USING ABBREVIATIONS

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 45

### 4.1 Introduction to Searching Using Abbreviations

One of the values that clinicians can immediately see from electronic noting is the use of ‘acceleration’ facilities, such as ‘hot keys’ and shorthand codes. The current search can benefit from the use of ‘abbreviation’ search.

The designs show how the clinician can type in certain abbreviations of section labels. The search engine deals with the abbreviations in a similar way to other synonyms of the section labels.

For example, the clinician may type ‘PMH’ and the system will offer ‘Past Medical History’ in the results.

## THEME 5 – SNOMED CT SEARCH TRIGGER

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 50

### 5.1 Introduction to SNOMED CT Search Trigger

As part of electronic clinical noting, there may be many occasions where the clinician records a key clinical term (such as an individual problem or procedure), and they may do this meaningfully and efficiently by searching for and selecting an appropriate SNOMED CT term. Sometimes the clinician may enter several such terms sequentially (such as when they are listing items, such as in a past medical history).

Associated with certain terms may be one or more templates which, for example, may allow the clinician to enter further details and values relating to the term. For example, if the clinician indicates that the patient may have deep vein thrombosis, the template may offer them a Wells’ Score to further assess this diagnosis.

|Col1|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||||
||**Illustration of a suggested template list**||

By suggesting templates, the UI may also reduce the risk that the clinician enters those further details as free text (for example, in an ‘additional details’ free text field).

For example if the clinician has performed an arterial blood gas analysis, it is preferred that they enter the results in a form rather than as free text. The UI can encourage this by suggesting the relevant templates once the clinician has entered the term ‘arterial blood gas analysis’.

## THEME 6 – FREE TEXT TRIGGER

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 61

### 6.1 Introduction to Free Text Trigger

Although there will be occasions where the clinician actively searches for individual SNOMED CT terms, often the quickest and most appropriate entry format will be free text. In these instances, there is a risk that the clinician enters data which would be better recorded as structured data (for example, via a form) than as free text.

Therefore, the designs in this theme show how the UI can:

 - Offer templates based upon terms it matches in the free text

 - Allow the clinician to choose between and open these templates

|Col1|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||||
||**Illustration of visually tagging a term for which related templates have been found**||

The designs assume that the terms which the UI matches are SNOMED CT terms (before identifying which templates are associated with those terms). However, they stop short of showing how this feature may integrate with full SNOMED CT text parsing and the emphasis is upon offering templates rather than encoding terms within the text.

## THEME 7 – BROWSING

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 69

### 7.1 Introduction to Browsing

In addition to showing how the clinician can search for sections within the acute medical admission form, the designs also illustrate another familiar way of navigating data structure, namely browsing.

The clinician may use a ‘tree’ to find and open the section they require. The advantage given by browsing rather than searching is that the clinician can see the structure available, which may be particularly useful for clinicians who are unfamiliar with the precise structure of the template. The disadvantage is that it may require more actions to browse rather than search, and browsing may be best done with a mouse whereas a lot of the noting may be done via a keyboard. This may make the

search a more attractive option in places, especially for clinicians who are more familiar with the structure and know exactly what they want.

This design consultation assumes that a mixed economy of browse and search is the most accommodating solution which can deal with varying levels of experience and different types of noting needs.

The clinician may browse up and down the tree, and open sections by clicking on them.

### 7.4 Next steps

**Next steps:**

  - Further understand the possible interaction between the search and browse features

  - Test the browse feature alongside the search features in an interactive prototype.
Refine the designs where appropriate

  - Explore how some sections could be further nested in order to make the browsing
experience clearer. For example, nest all the sections with the prefix ‘Observations and Findings’ into a single item of the same name and remove the prefix from all the remaining labels

**Future exploration:**

  - Explore how the browse feature could be used to indicate which sections the clinician
has addressed (that is, opened and possibly entered information into) and which remain closed. This gives the clinician a quick overview of what is left to do

## THEME 8 – REVISITING AND ADDING TEMPLATES

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 74

### 8.1 Introduction to Revisiting and Adding Templates

As the clinician progresses through the notes, there may be times where they need to revisit sections that they have already opened. In those cases, they could scroll back up the form to revisit them. However, in this theme, the designs show how the UI may assist the clinician to access previously opened sections by using the search or browse functions.

The designs show how the UI will open a new instance of the section, while pre-populating it with the previous data, so the clinician does not need to look for the previous instance.

### 8.1 Introduction to Revisiting and Adding Templates

In other instances, the clinician may wish not to revisit existing sections or subsections but to add a new instance.

For example, the clinician may wish to add a new ‘Blood pressure’ subsection in order to add a new reading not to edit the blood pressure they entered earlier in the clerking.

Therefore, the design will show how the clinician can add further instances of a data type, where this is permitted (such as for examination measurement values).

### 8.4 Next steps

**Next steps:**

  - Test the design in an interactive prototype. Refine the design where appropriate

  - Further define where fields can be duplicated (that is, so the clinician can enter
multiple instances of the same value type). Currently the designs assume that certain numerical examination measurement values can be duplicated (such as vital signs data). However, there may be other types of data that can be duplicated

  - Explore in more detail how sections may be revisited via the browsing feature, and
whether any further UI will be required

**Future exploration:**

   - Explore ways in which the UI may alert clinicians that they are entering duplicate
statements (that is, statements they have entered into the form earlier)

## THEME 9 – REORDERING

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 85

### 9.1 Introduction to Reordering

It is assumed that sections are arranged according to the order in which they were added, but this may make it difficult for clinicians to assess what they have done and what is missing. It would be simpler to scan through the sections in a standard order as, this way, it becomes more apparent what is missing (as missing sections would stand out against the familiar pattern).

Therefore, the designs in this theme show how the UI can:

 - Show how clinicians can reorder the sections within the form according to a standard sequence, so that
they can better review the completeness of their note

 - Show how clinicians may rearrange the sections back to the order in which they were added

### 9.4 Next steps

**Immediate next steps:**

  - Design, test and refine a control for reordering the form. Address the type of control,
where it may be offered and how it should be labelled

  - Consider the implications of allowing the clinician to manually reorder the sections

  - Create a design feature to allow the clinician to manually reorder the sections

**Future exploration:**

  - Explore whether to present the clinician with a reordered view before saving and
closing the form. Would this be a redundant step?

### Areas/questions for further work and study

The previous sections have outlined next steps and further areas of exploration. To summarise the immediate next steps:

  - Test and refine the existing designs

  - Answer any relevant design questions that remain open

  - Translate the design features into CUI guidance

  - Refine and prioritise the future areas of design exploration

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 91

### Areas/questions for further work and study

Additionally, there are some general themes which have not been discussed, but which would be important to address:

  - Providing a special preview feature in order to help the clinician scan through the salient points
of their notes. The format may be more condensed than the entry view (which contains additional screen furniture, such as drop-down mechanisms and empty fields)

  - Exploring the end-to-end passage of data from admission to discharge, including possible
viewing and querying of the data

  - Exploring how to ‘cite’ previous data in the current notes

  - Further exploring whether and how clinicians can hide or close template sections that they have
added to a form. Our research into this topic proved inconclusive, with clinicians failing to understand why they would want to perform this action. We would want to conclude whether such actions should be disallowed
