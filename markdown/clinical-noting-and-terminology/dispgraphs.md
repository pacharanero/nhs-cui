Table 1: Changes Since the Last Baseline Version

#### 1.1 Customer Need

Clinical data represented numerically, such as physiological observations or ‘vital signs’ readings, play a crucial role in clinical decision-making and in communicating with patients, which in turn can influence patient involvement with their treatment regimen. In addition to accurately reading such numerical data, clinicians must also interpret patterns in the data to assess the patient’s status and to determine the best course of action. This often requires them to rapidly assimilate multiple series of data. Often, these patterns are difficult to spot initially, but become more distinct as a pathology develops and it is imperative that clinicians can detect them as early as possible. Pattern detection is a universal human capacity which people tend to do very efficiently and often subconsciously. However, the detection and meaning of a data pattern can be heavily influenced by the way in which the data is presented, and misinterpretation may occur if the data is not presented in a way that clinicians can easily understand.

In a clinical context, this may mean that important patterns could be missed or are detected too late. Although, in acute care, early warning scores are effective for detecting problems, in other clinical contexts, and for subtle data patterns, measurements may need to be displayed graphically for changes to be perceived.

Also, in order that patients can comply with the care intervention, such as changing their lifestyle or taking medication, it is crucial that they can understand their condition, their likely prognosis and the physiological targets they must achieve in order to get better. Health psychology research has shown that patients’ understanding of their condition and likely outcomes are often subject to bias. Whereas people often find it hard to see trends and deficits in numerical data, graphical representations effectively communicate the pattern and direction of physiological signs, along with the changes that patients’ must effect to reach their targets. With this understanding, patients’ get feedback on their behaviour in order to better regulate it.

This guidance aims to define the key factors that influence the interpretation of patterns in clinical data, focusing upon scatter and line graphs and tables.

This guidance draws upon User Interface (UI) current best practice and upon research into the use of graphs and tables in clinical settings.

This guidance is for use by Independent Software Vendors to ensure that good design principles support clinicians’ interpretation of numerical data, reveal critical patterns and assist users in accessing specific data values.

#### 1.2 Potential Patient Safety Risks to be Mitigated

The development of this guidance relied on identifying a set of high level tasks associated with the use of clinical charts (that is, graphs and tables).

HSCIC Controlled Document

We identified risks associated with those tasks by running risk assessment activities, interviewing clinicians in early design analysis and requirements capture exercises (including **{R5}** ) and consulting a number of sources, including existing studies [1] and papers ( **{R11, R15}** ).

These tasks were located in a set of typical user scenarios and a set of potential patient safety risks and consequences were noted with these scenarios. A full outline of these tasks, scenarios, and potential safety risks can be found in APPENDIX A.

The high level tasks comprise:

- Read the current data values

- Compare the current data values with past readings

- Check if the current data values exceed, fail to exceed or fall below a threshold

- Check for significant patterns over time in a series of data values

- Check for significant interactions between data series

- Check the provenance of the data values

- Check if there is a significant change in values from their normal levels

The main potential patient safety risks identified in the context of clinicians interpreting chart information include:

- Overestimation of a trend, either a rise or fall

- Not viewing a relevant previous set of data or not recognising when it was taken

- Not identifying a drop in blood pressure as being significant:

 Not seeing how much it has dropped

 Not seeing how quickly it has dropped

- Not seeing a drop in blood pressure in the context of the oxygen, pulse and temperature

remaining constant

- Not seeing that the respiratory rate has increased slightly

- Not correctly reading the absolute values of a measure

- Not factoring in that the differences in readings may be partially or wholly accounted for

by the change in settings in which the readings were taken

- Not seeing the current configuration of the vital signs (for example, high, low, rising)

- Not recognising that the data is now showing a new trend

- Not recognising a previous trend

- Not recognising the differences between the two trends

- Not recognising that the change in trend is significant

- Not recognising where the patient’s current blood pressure readings are in relation to the

target range

- Not accurately reading the patient’s current blood pressure reading

- Not being able to view the current configuration of the observations data in relation to the

patient’s usual levels

- Not identifying the rise in blood pressure and pulse as significant:

 Not seeing by how much they had risen

 Not seeing how quickly they had risen

- Not identifying the drop in a measure as significant:

 Not seeing by how much they had dropped

 Not seeing how quickly they had dropped

- Not being able to view the changes in blood pressure and oxygen saturations in relation to

each other

- Not recognising that the blood pressure has stabilised

- Not recognising that the patient’s blood pressure readings are in the target range

The consequences for such risks could be:

- A delayed diagnosis

- A delayed treatment

- An incorrect diagnosis

- A missed diagnosis

- An incorrect treatment

- Failure to comply with treatment regimen

The design guidance points outlined in later sections aim to mitigate these patient risks.

#### 1.3 Scope

The main purpose of this guidance is to allow electronic clinical systems to clearly and effectively communicate levels and patterns of data to the clinician and patient.

In order to provide further focus to this guidance, it is primarily restricted to the key physiological observations that serve as fundamental indicators of patient health, otherwise known as ‘vital signs’ data. Specifically, the guidance addresses these forms of data:

- Blood pressure, comprising systolic and diastolic pressures, measured in millimetres of

mercury (mmHg)

- Body temperature, measured in degrees centigrade (˚C)

- Pulse rate, measured in beats per minute

- Respiratory rate, measured in breaths per minute

- Oxygen saturation, expressed as a percentage (%)

These are commonly used, individually or in combination with themselves or other measurements, throughout the healthcare industry. The regular recording of these measurements is also mandated by the recent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for acute care

**{R1}** . Those guidelines serve as exemplars for this guidance. It is expected that guidance applying to those measurements can also be generalised to other data types, although care must be taken by suppliers when doing so. In some cases, additional design considerations may apply that are out of scope for the current guidance. Parts of this guidance expand this set of exemplars to include some blood test results, such as serum creatinine and serum urea levels, but generally the focus is upon the five ‘vital signs’ data listed above.

Patterns of change through time are formed primarily by combinations of four characteristics (taken from Stephen Few **{R8}** ):

- Magnitude of change

- Shape of change

- Velocity of change

- Direction of change

Positioning graphical representations of data in a two dimensional plot area is an effective, efficient and well-recognised way of communicating these factors. Time-based scatter plots with interpolated data points are currently used throughout the healthcare industry, often in paper form. Although more innovative, but unconventional, data visualisations are available, this guidance focuses upon the design of interpolated scatter plots because their understanding is immediate and relatively little learning is required by the clinician to interpret them.

The purpose of the guidance is therefore to ensure that this conventional graphing method is as clear, efficient and safe as possible when presented electronically, rather than trying to push the boundaries of data visualisation techniques. Additionally, there will be occasions where the clinician will also want to view the data solely as numerical data; if, for example, they are more concerned with the absolute values rather than the patterns they form.

To achieve these goals, this guidance will identify the basic components of both conventional graphs and tables and will address these in turn. The primary focus is upon the static views of graphs and tables whilst acknowledging that the interaction between the clinician and the data also has an impact on the interpretation of data and needs careful handling. The emphasis is upon format rather than specific content, although with indication where certain types of content will be required.

**Note**

Definitions for terms which have a specific meaning in the context of this document are listed in section 11.2.

##### 1.3.1 Data Values and Labels

Creating symbols for data glyphs in graphs This guidance does not specify symbols for specific data types, with the exception of blood pressure. Instead, it outlines the rules that a designer must follow when creating a set of data symbols

Identifying data series This guidance does not specify the exact wording of the data series (for example, we will not mandate ‘Heart rate’ over ‘Pulse rate’). However, it recommends that suppliers use standard terms where possible (for example, from the Systematised Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT)

Displaying data units This guidance does not specify a comprehensive list of units

This guidance does not cover translating values from one unit to another

Displaying two data values that are linked together This guidance does not cover any value linkages that are not blood pressure

Page 4

HSCIC Controlled Document

Displaying paired values, such as systolic and diastolic pressure. Also, displaying pairs of paired values, such as lying and standing blood pressures (which are themselves pairs)

This guidance does not cover paired values that are not blood pressures

Displaying numerical value labels in graphs This guidance does not specify exact positions of labels. Also, the precision of data values will not apply to any data variable other than the vital signs data series

Displaying numerical values in tables

Allowing access to numerical (digital) value labels in graphs

Distinguishing manually input data values from values feeding in directly from a machine.

**Note**

Manually input readings include those that have been read from a machine, but manually entered

Allowing the user to focus on specific data values

**Note**

This will include separate guidance for graphs and for tables

Special guidance when overlaying graphs

This guidance does not specify in precise detail the mechanism used to access views to numerical values. For example, although it may recommend a hover-over or a toggle switch, it is not going to detail the precise UI interaction required for a hover-over, nor the exact formatting or position of the toggle switch

This guidance does not provide any special guidance for continuous data input. Its focus is on readings that have been made (and entered) by a clinician. Where readings come directly from a medical device, it recommends that these are distinct from manually input readings

This guidance does not specify exact mechanisms for focusing upon data values, nor hotspot dimensions or rules nor the precise user interaction required for selecting a value (for example, the precise look of a fish-eye or a crosshair)

Displaying data overviews or summaries This guidance does not specify the exact form, formatting or interaction of look-head scrolling nor thumbnails.

This guidance does not specify an exhaustive list of summary data that could be displayed

Allowing the user to switch between graphs and tables This guidance does not specify the exact mechanisms for switching between

graphs and tables

This guidance does not cover the display of mean, peak and low values:

 When to display peaks and lows

 Labelling of peaks and lows

 For what range to display peaks and lows

 Where to display peaks and lows data

Table 2: Data Values and Labels Scope

##### 1.3.2 Scaling

Optimum scaling This guidance does not cover any data that is not featured in the list of observations data (that is, the vital signs)

The guidance may not be able to define precisely an optimum scaling; instead it outlines what factors to consider when setting the scaling and ways to ensure that scaling is kept consistent within any given system

Minimum scales This guidance does not specify absolute minimum scales (that is, the shallowest that the y-axis can be in relation to the x-axis)

Page 5

HSCIC Controlled Document

Dynamic scaling This guidance does not cover any data that is not in the list of vital signs

This guidance does not define any mechanism for changing the scaling (for example, a zoom control or a scale slider).

Dealing with extreme values

Table 3: Scaling Scope

##### 1.3.3 Axes

X-axis and y-axis arrangements This guidance does not recommend default views, but will not go as far as recommending that no other data except for time should appear on the x-axis

Time axis intervals This guidance does not define a mechanism for setting or changing time intervals or scales

Data variable (non-time) axis intervals This guidance does not cover logarithmic data representations

Data variable (non-time) ranges

Gridlines This guidance does not define a mechanism for revealing/hiding gridlines

Axes labels

Special axis considerations in the event of overlaying graphs

Table 4: Axes Scope

This guidance does not define the workings of any interactive mechanisms for viewing overlaid graphs

##### 1.3.4 Layout Density and Formatting

Typefaces

Background colours

Foreground colours

Labelling of graphs and tables This guidance will only be defining label design, not content

This guidance does not define the optimum or minimum width and height of the graphing area

**Note**

This may need to be defined in the context of an assumed screen resolution or as a function of screen resolution

Table 5: Layout Density and Formatting Scope

##### 1.3.5 Simultaneous Views of Multiple Data Series

Considerations for viewing multiple, non-overlaid graphs

This guidance does not cover mechanisms for adding or removing data series from view. It will not define mechanisms for changing the order of multiple graphs

Considerations for viewing multiple, overlaid graphs This guidance does not define mechanisms for overlaying or semi-overlaying data series

Table 6: Simultaneous Views of Multiple Data Series Scope

##### 1.3.6 Interpolation

When to show interpolation This guidance does not specify what to do when interpolation has to cease for a data series (for example, when data is unknown for a given period)

Formatting of interpolation This guidance does not define any algorithms for smoothing interpolation lines

Special formatting in the event of overlaying or semi-overlaying data series

Table 7: Interpolation Scope

##### 1.3.7 Indicative Ranges

Normal ranges This guidance does not define mechanisms for adjusting normal ranges nor for switching normal ranges on or off

This guidance does not specify the label text for normal ranges.

This guidance does not specify target ranges and critical thresholds:

 When to show target ranges, critical ranges or thresholds

 Formatting of target ranges, critical ranges or thresholds

 Formatting of target ranges, critical ranges or thresholds

 Labelling target ranges, critical ranges or thresholds

 Changing target ranges, critical ranges or thresholds

It does not define mechanisms for changing target ranges, critical ranges or thresholds, nor does it specify the label text for target ranges, critical ranges or thresholds.

Table 9: Tables Scope

##### 1.3.9 Additional Contextual Information

Displaying contextual data This guidance does not list all contextual information to be displayed

Accessing contextual data This guidance does not define the precise mechanisms for accessing contextual data that is not immediately visible

Table 10: Additional Contextual Information Scope

##### 1.3.10 Additional Visualisation Mechanisms

There are many potential data visualisation mechanisms that could be employed to assist the interpretation of clinical observations data, such as zoom views, event timeline overlays and further statistical analysis and calculation methods, such as mean and peak values and trend lines.

However, these are out of scope for the current work. Consideration was given to a mechanism for calculating deviations between a baseline value set by the clinician and more recent values, but this was not deemed essential by the clinical audience who reviewed the scope of this guidance.

#### 1.4 Assumptions

**A1** Absolute space (that is, the dimensions of the screen available for displaying a graph or table) will vary between suppliers.

**A2** Although this guidance focuses upon vital signs data, where they deem it appropriate, suppliers should apply this guidance to other data series

**A3** The interpretation of graphs and tables should be done in the context of early warning scoring systems where applicable (for example, Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) or Patient At-Risk Scores (PARS))

**A4** Where necessary, indicative or ‘normal’ ranges for a given population should be agreed by the supplier with the appropriate professional bodies or appropriate clinical authority.

**A5** Measurement labels should be expressed in SNOMED-CT terms

**A6** Clinicians may view graphs and tables on a variety of hardware platforms. However, special provision for non-PC platforms is not covered by the current guidance

Table 11: Assumptions

#### 1.5 Dependencies

**D1** There exists an accompanying mechanism for entering the observations data (not in scope in the current document)

**D2** The display of dates must conform to the guidance for Date Display **{R3}**

**D3** The display of times must conform to the guidance for Time Display **{R4}**

Table 12: Dependencies

GTAB-016 2.1 Symbol sizes should remain unchanged, except when the data points are so close as to potentially overlap. Symbols should not increase in size upon zooming in or changing timescales

GTAB-017 2.1 Where a data value corresponds to a time that is less specific than the intervals shown in the selected time range, feature a different symbology (in addition to not interpolating the points)

GTAB-018 2.2 Every individual data series must be labelled (Example 13)

GTAB-019 2.2 Data series labels must be visible all the time that the values are displayed on-screen

GTAB-020 2.2 Where there is only a single data series in a graph space (that is, where there are no data overlays), the labelling should be positioned above the graph.

GTAB-021 2.2 Position the label either to the left of each graph or immediately above, and to the top left of, each graph (depending upon the space available) (Example 15, Example 16)

GTAB-022 2.2 Minimise the height of the labels positioned above the graphs in order to minimise the distance between graphs

GTAB-023 2.2 Visually associate the label with its corresponding graph by positioning it immediately adjacent to it (Example 17)

GTAB-024 2.2 Where there are multiple data series in a graph space (such as where one data series is overlaid or semioverlaid upon another), the labelling should be positioned immediately next to or very close to the relevant data series (Example 19)

GTAB-025 2.2 Do not orient labels vertically (Example 18)

GTAB-026 2.2 Do not feature labels as watermarked text on the graph area (Example 20, Example 21)

GTAB-027 2.3 Data unit labels must be visible at all times that a data series is graphed ( Example 22)

GTAB-029 2.3 Do not display values taken with different units in the same sequence of data values in a table (either displayed in a column or in a row)

GTAB-030 2.3 If data values have been converted from one unit to another, the system must clearly communicate that this has happened at the level of the data value points

GTAB-031 2.3 Data unit labels may be expressed as abbreviations (such as ‘mmHg’)

GTAB-036 2.3 Data units should be displayed alongside the data series labels (Example 23)

GTAB-037 2.3 Data unit labels can be displayed in a less prominent font size or weight than the data type labels (Example 23, Example 25)

GTAB-038 2.3 Data units do not need to be displayed next to each data value (Example 24)

GTAB-039 2.4 Systolic and diastolic blood pressures should be displayed on the same graph area (Example 28)

GTAB-040 2.4 Systolic and diastolic blood pressures should be displayed as opposite ends of a vertical line (Example 28)

GTAB-041 2.4 The intersection points (that is, the intersection between the x and y axes) for both systolic and diastolic pressures should be represented by a short horizontal bar, thus creating a double-ended ‘T’

GTAB-042 2.4 The short horizontal bar which aligns with the y-axis values of the systolic and diastolic pressures should be a little thicker than any gridlines overlaid on the graph area

GTAB-043 2.4 Do not interpolate the blood pressure data points without the vertical lines connecting the systolic and diastolic pressure values

GTAB-044 2.4 When data points are positioned tightly together, the symbol becomes a straight vertical line between the systolic and diastolic values

GTAB-074 3.1 If re-scaling is required, minimise the number of scale gradations and/or the number of re-scaling steps

GTAB-075 3.1 Upon re-scaling from a default view scale, the system should display that the view is re-scaled

GTAB-076 3.1 In the event that, on a given scaling, the data requires more space than is available, re-display according to certain priorities

GTAB-077 3.1 If the scaling solution is based upon a shift up or down along an axis, provide a scroll feature when data falls outside of the visible axis range

GTAB-079 3.1 A thumbnail can be used to communicate all the data within a given timeframe if the main graph area does not show all the data simultaneously (Example 46)

GTAB-080 3.1 Where possible, show the data points on the thumbnail, although for large timescales containing much data this will not be possible and, in those cases, just show interpolation. (Example 46)

GTAB-081 3.1 Display the upper and lower axis ‘tick’ marks on the thumbnail (Example 46)

GTAB-082 3.1 Do not position the thumbnail in a position that obstructs the main graph (Example 46)

GTAB-083 3.1 Where appropriate, overlay an indicative range or line. Display this both on the main graph area and the thumbnail

GTAB-084 4.1 If time is displayed as one of the axes, it should be displayed along the (horizontal) x-axis (Example 48, Example 49)

GTAB-096 4.4 By default, the x-axis should be constrained to one of a set of defined time ranges

GTAB-097 4.4 As new data points are added to a graph, do not change the time scaling. If adding the new data point means that the current data exceeds the time range, shift the time window to include the new data rather than increasing the time range in size. (Example 58)

GTAB-098 4.4 Do not show all data by default, unless there is a specific clinical reason for doing so

GTAB-099 4.4 If all data must be shown by default, the data should be shown within the nearest set timescale within which all the data to be displayed can be shown

GTAB-114 4.6 Provide labelling of the time-range (Example 69)

GTAB-115 5.1 Display data points in high saturation colours except in those situations where the system needs to distinguish one data series over others (Example 70, Example 72)

GTAB-116 5.1 The colours of the data series should be approximately equal in terms of saturation except where one data series is being emphasised over the others

GTAB-117 5.1 Where one data series is required to stand out against the other data series, the others can be displayed in lower saturated versions of the same hues

GTAB-156 6.3 If two axes are shown, label each axis (Example 85)

GTAB-157 6.3 If two data series displayed in the same graph area are measured in different units and the axes gradation spacing is different, do not show horizontal gridlines

GTAB-158 6.3 When multiple data series are displayed in the same graph area, label each data series in an appropriate place (Example 84)

GTAB-159 6.3 Avoid distinguishing multiple data series displayed in the same graph area with varying line styles

GTAB-160 6.3 When multiple data series are displayed in the same graph area, display the interpolation lines as semi-transparent (Example 84)

GTAB-161 6.3 Avoid relying on the distinction between green and red when displaying multiple data series

GTAB-162 6.3 Where multiple data series are displayed in the same graph area, feature hollowed symbols, rather than the usual solid symbols bound by a black border (Example 84)

GTAB-163 6.3 Where data points become tightly packed, reduce their size. However, do not reduce them to a height that is the same as or less than the width of the interpolation line (Example 86)

GTAB-164 7.1 By default, with certain exceptions, provide interpolation between data points (Example 87)

GTAB-165 7.1 Allows users to switch interpolation lines off

GTAB-166 7.1 Interpolation should comprise straight lines between data points. By default, do not ‘smooth’ interpolation lines (Example 88)

GTAB-185 8.1 Feature the systolic and diastolic normal ranges in different shades of colour (Example 95)

GTAB-186 9.1 Orient tables in a consistent manner, for a given data type and/or clinical setting or procedure

GTAB-187 9.1 Tables should follow a conventional orientation if one exists

GTAB-188 9.1 If a table is oriented with time ordered horizontally, by default the most recent data value must appear at the far right-hand side (that is, sorted from left-to-right) while ensuring that the most recent values are visible by default (Example 96)

GTAB-189 9.1 If a table is oriented with time ordered vertically, by default the most recent data value must appear at the top of the table (that is, sorted from bottom-to-top) while ensuring that the most recent values are visible by default (Example 97)

GTAB-190 9.1 Users must be able to re-sort data within the columns or rows

GTAB-191 9.1 Users must be able to re-orient the table (that is, transpose the rows to columns and vice versa)

GTAB-192 9.2 Feature light banding along the rows (Example 99)

GTAB-193 9.2 Do not feature heavy gridlines (Example 102)

GTAB-194 9.2 Round data displayed in table cells entries where it is not misleading to do so

GTAB-201 9.2 Align the decimal marker for all numerals in a column

GTAB-202 9.2 If some numbers in a column do not feature a decimal place, but others do, do not add an unnecessary decimal place but instead provide padding within cells to allow for decimals (Example 100)

GTAB-203 9.3 Align column headings with their associated data (Example 104)

GTAB-204 9.3 If column headings are centred, they should be visually aligned over the column of data

GTAB-211 9.3 In wide tables, row headings may be provided at both ends of the row

GTAB-212 9.3 Allow sufficient space between columns to clearly separate them but no more (excessive space impedes horizontal scanning) (Example 104, Example 106)

GTAB-213 9.3 Do not display column headings vertically

GTAB-214 9.3 Column headings may be displayed at 45º to the column, if the heading is too long to display horizontally and cannot be wrapped adequately

GTAB-215 9.3 Provide special formatting if column headings are displayed at 45º so that it is clear which heading applies to which column (Example 107)

GTAB-216 9.3 Do not alternate between the directions of the 45º oriented text in the same table

GTAB-217 9.3 Always display both column and row headings

GTAB-218 9.3 Ensure that the column and row headings are always visible

Scaling refers to the mapping of numeric intervals in the underlying data onto physical distances in the graph area. In other words, a scale provides a means of assigning specific values to the data points on the graph, based upon their location along the scale lines.

For example, an hour may be represented by a distance of 10 mm running from left-to-right along the (horizontal) x-axis while a rise of 0.5º centigrade of body temperature may be represented by 5mm running from bottom-to-top along the (vertical) y-axis.

The current guidance addresses both the x-axis and y-axis scales in combination as this has importance in dictating the ‘shape’ of the pattern formed by the location of the data points, which can influence clinicians’ interpretation of the underlying data.

The guidance assumes a ‘common’, linear scaling rather than a non-linear scaling for the observations data, as the quantitative interval from one axis marking to the next is always the same. Non-linear scaling, such as ‘logarithmic’ scaling, may have uses in clinical graphing, but analysis has not identified reasons for their inclusion when measuring the physiological ‘vital signs’ that are in scope for the current guidance.

### 9 TABLES GUIDANCE DETAILS

Tables are an important medium for displaying clinical data. They are not as effective as graphs at revealing trends – and can be off-putting to the reader, especially if large – but tables possess some unique benefits over graphs:

- They can hold many data cells

- They can allow numeric data to be extracted easily and accurately

- They can easily accommodate wide ranges of data

Graphs emphasise the patterns and trends in data, but do not make the extraction of the values as easy as a table and cannot always easily present data with wide discrepancies of scale.

This section outlines the key factors to consider when creating tables that are safe and easy to use.

#### 9.1 Guidelines – Table Orientation

|Col1|Example 97: Tables with time running vertically should be ordered with the most recent reading at the top by default|
|---|---|
||Example 98: Do not sort time from top-to-bottom in a vertically oriented table by default<br>|
||**Rationale**|
||Following CUI research, this guidance concludes that there is no one way that clinicians must orient their data. Some clinicians<br>expressed a preference for viewing tables that had time running vertically down them, whereas others felt more comfortable with a<br>horizontal time axis**{R5}**.<br>Other studies have shown that there are benefits to either orientation, although certain actions are easier to do with one of the<br>orientations. For example, scanning through information for particular values is easier with time vertically oriented**{R2, R8}**, as is<br>interpreting trends from the data.<br>On the other hand, some clinicians feel that the progression of time is easier to understand when it is oriented horizontally, akin to the<br>graph’s x-axis. As the relevant BSi standard (7581) states, ‘Rows are easier to read than columns, but columns are easier to<br>scan.…The reader’s need to scan tables should influence which information should be in rows and which in columns.’**{R2}**.<br>Therefore the current guidance is not mandating the use of one or other orientation. However, the default orientation of the table<br>should remain consistent for a given clinical situation or data type. For example, if blood tests in a GP software programme are<br>displayed by default with a vertical time axis on one day, a vertical time axis should be the default on a later day, unless there is a<br>clinical reason to do otherwise.<br>The basic designs shown in this section have been tested by CUI research**{R5}**. The research demonstrated that clinicians found the<br>tables to be clear.|

#### 11.2 Definitions

NHS Entity Within this document, defined as a single NHS organisation or group that is operated within a single technical infrastructure environment by a defined group of IT administrators.

The Authority The organisation implementing the NHS National Programme for IT (currently NHS Connecting for Health).

Current best practice Current best practice is used rather than best practice, as over time best practice guidance may change or be revised due to changes to products, changes in technology, or simply the additional field deployment experience that comes over time.

Normal range A clinically relevant range for a data series, defined by an upper and a lower parameter, that expresses the normal values expected for a given healthy population, in isolation to other data series. Values that fall outside of a normal range may potentially indicate a health problem and a cause for concern. Which normal range applies to a given patient may depend upon certain aspects of their individual demography. For example, the age or gender of the patient may determine which normal range applies to them at a given point in time.

Target range or threshold A range, or a point above or below a threshold, associated with a positive health outcome that is formulated by the care giver when planning and delivering the patient’s care. Unlike normal ranges, target ranges and thresholds are patient-specific, rather than population-specific.

HSCIC Controlled Document

Critical range or threshold A range, or a point above or below a threshold, associated with a negative health outcome that is formulated by the care giver when planning and delivering the patient’s care. Typically, if data values fall within such a range (or above or below such a threshold) warnings should be raised, such as a nurse contacting the doctor. This type of range or threshold is patient-specific rather than population-specific.

Reference range A standard range that helps the viewer of a graph understand the absolute values (or at least the significance) of the data points by locating their position in relation to the range. A reference range may comprise a normal range.

Indicative range Same as ‘Reference range’.

Scale The relationship between the physical distances displayed in the graph and the relationships between the underlying data values. For example, an hour may be represented by a distance of 10 mm running from left-to-right along the (horizontal) x-axis plane, while a rise of 10 mmHg of systolic pressure may be represented by 5 mm running from bottom-to-top along the (vertical) y-axis plane.

References to ‘scale’ include both the x-axis and y-axis scales, as it is often the ratio between these two that is important to the clinician’s interpretation of the data.

Axes The orthogonal (perpendicular) planes that represent data continuums, such as ‘pulse rate’. On a two dimensional graph area, there will be a minimum of two axes, the x- and y-axis, one of those being ‘time’. In special cases of overlaid data, there may be three axes in the same graph area.

X-axis The x-axis marks the horizontal scale and is orthogonal to the y-axis.

Y-axis The y-axis marks the vertical scale and is orthogonal to the x-axis.

Axis range The range of potential values shown in the graph along a single axis in a view.

Axis marking Markings of data increments along the axes.

Gridlines Horizontal and/or vertical lines shown on the graph area aligned with regular increments in the data. The purpose of these lines is to help the viewer identify the values of the data points.

Data point A visual representation of a data value.

Data unit The measurement units in which a data series is being expressed, such as ‘beats per minute’.

Data series A set of data of a single measurement type, such as ‘pulse rate’ or ‘body temperature’.

Interpolation Lines added to the graph that sequentially join up the data points. Interpolation assists the perception of the data values and the patterns in which they fall.

Graph area The two-dimensional blank space in which data points may be displayed.

Logarithmic scaling Scaling where a series of numbers are produced by increasing the power of a base number by one for each sequential interval.

### APPENDIX A HIGH-LEVEL TASK SCENARIOS

The following scenarios were developed in order to represent how graphs and tables could be used within a clinical setting. They were originally written in collaboration with the CUI clinical specific audience and then validated with a wider set of clinicians. Designs were built around these scenarios and these led, in part, to the creation of the guidance.

#### PART I Emergency Department Assessment

A nurse is performing an initial assessment on a patient who has been brought in by ambulance into her Accident and Emergency (A&E) ward complaining of chest pains.

The nurse reads the set of observations recorded by paramedics and then records the patient’s vital signs onto their chart.

Comparing the two charts, the nurse notices that the patient’s blood pressure has dropped significantly, the respiratory rate has increased slightly and oxygen, pulse and temperature have remained constant.

High Level Tasks  Read the current data values

 Check the provenance of the data values

 Compare the current data values with past readings

 Check for significant interactions between data series

Potential Risks High:

 Nurse fails to either view the previous (ambulance) data or fails to recognise when it was taken

 Nurse fails to identify the drop in blood pressure as being significant

 They fail to see how much it has dropped

 They fail to see how quickly it has dropped

Medium:

 Nurse fails to see the drop in blood pressure in the context of the oxygen, pulse and temperature

remaining constant

Low:

 Nurse fails to see that the respiratory rate has increased slightly

 Nurse does not correctly read the absolute values of the blood pressure

 Nurse does not correctly read the absolute values of the respiratory rate oxygen, pulse and

temperature.

 Nurse does not factor in that the differences in readings may be fully or partially accounted for by

the change in settings in which the readings were taken

Possible consequence of risks: Delayed diagnosis or understanding of problem

Key Feature Areas Most Significant:

 Intuitive and appropriate scaling

 Viewing trends and interactions, including interpolation

Quite Significant:

 Simultaneous views of multiple data series

 Clear and appropriate axes

Reasonably Significant:

 Access to and display of supporting contextual data

 Support for baseline deviation calculations

Basic Practice:

 Clear presentation of data values and units

 Appropriate layout, density and formatting of graph spaces, values and text

#### PART II Intensive Care Unit Monitoring

A paediatrics consultant is called to see a baby with meningitis who isn’t passing urine.

On the way to the baby, the consultant reads a summary of the patient’s history.

The consultant then views the chart and sees, among other observations, that the baby’s blood pressure is high while the oxygen saturations are low and the pulse has been rising. The baby’s high temperature also indicates pyrexia.

The consultant suspects that the baby is fluid overloaded.

The consultant puts the baby onto a ventilator and prescribes Forusemide.

The consultant then monitors the baby at regular intervals to check the baby’s progress.

High Level Tasks  Read the current data values

 Check if the current data values fail to exceed or fall below a threshold

 Check for significant patterns over time in a series of data values

 Check for significant interactions between data series

Potential Risks High:

 Consultant fails to see the current configuration of the vital signs (for example, high, low, rising)

 Consultant fails to understand the current configuration of the vital signs in relation to the patient’s

usual levels

Medium:

 Consultant fails to identify the rise in blood pressure and pulse as significant:

 Fails to see how much they had risen

 Fails to see how quickly they had risen

 Consultant fails to identify the drop in oxygen saturations as significant:

 Fails to see how much they had dropped

 Fails to see how quickly they had dropped

Possible consequence of risks: Incorrect treatment

Key Feature Areas Most Significant:

 Simultaneous views of multiple data series

 Intuitive and appropriate scaling

 Viewing data values in relation to normal ranges, targets and thresholds

Quite Significant:

 Clear and appropriate axes

 Viewing trends and interactions, including interpolation

 Support for baseline deviation calculations

Reasonably Significant:

 Clear presentation of data values and units

Basic Practice:

 Appropriate layout, density and formatting of graph spaces, values and text

#### PART III Renal Outpatients Unit

A doctor working in a renal outpatients unit is attending a patient with kidney disease who has been taking Irbesartan recently to reduce blood pressure.

The doctor views the patient’s blood pressure graph for the last couple of years, which suggests the patient has not been taking the medicine.

High Level Tasks  Read the current data values

 Compare the current data values with past readings

 Check if the current data values fail to exceed or fall below a threshold

 Check for significant patterns over time in a series of data values

Potential Risks High:

 Doctor fails to recognise that the data is now showing a new trend:

 Fails to see that trend

 Doctor fails to recognise the previous trend

 Doctor fails to recognise the differences between the two trends

 Doctor fails to understand that the change in trend is significant

Medium:

 Doctor fails to recognise where the patient’s current blood pressure readings are in relation to the

target range

Low:

 Doctor fails to accurately read the patient’s current blood pressure reading

Possible consequence of risks: Incorrect treatment

Key Feature Areas Most Significant:

 Viewing trends and interactions, including interpolation

 Clear and appropriate axes

Quite Significant:

 Viewing data values in relation to normal ranges, targets and thresholds

 Intuitive and appropriate scaling

Reasonably Significant:

 Support for baseline deviation calculations

Basic Practice:

 Clear presentation of data values and units

 Appropriate layout, density and formatting of graph spaces, values and text

#### PART IV Inpatient Monitoring

Variation 1: A nurse has been called to see an elderly inpatient who is very drowsy. The nurse views the patient’s chart and sees that the patient’s blood pressure has increased dramatically since the last set of readings, whereas their oxygen saturations have fallen.

The nurse suspects a possible intracranial bleed.

Variation 2: An inpatient on a ward is complaining of a severe headache and nausea and the nurse increases the observation schedule from 4 hourly to every 15 minutes.

On the second reading the nurse finds the blood pressure is increasing with an increased pulse rate and informs the doctor who then reviews the last day’s observations with the current ones.

High Level Tasks  Read the current data values

 Compare the current data values with past readings

 Check if the current data values fail to exceed or fall below a threshold

 Check for significant patterns over time in a series of data values

 Check for significant interactions between data series

Potential Risks High:

 Nurse fails to see the increase in blood pressure

 Nurse fails to see the drop in oxygen saturations

 Nurse fails to see the rise in blood pressure and drop in oxygen saturations as significant:

 Fails to see how much the readings have risen/dropped

 Fails to see how quickly the readings have risen/dropped

 Patient fails to understand the new trend in their blood pressure readings

Medium:

 Nurse fails to see the changes in blood pressure and oxygen saturations in relation to each other

Possible consequence of risks: Delayed diagnosis/ understanding of problem

Key Feature Areas Most Significant:

 Viewing trends and interactions, including interpolation

 Simultaneous views of multiple data series

 Intuitive and appropriate scaling

Quite Significant:

 Clear and appropriate axes

Reasonably Significant:

 Support for baseline deviation calculations

Basic Practice:

 Clear presentation of data values and units

 Appropriate layout, density and formatting of graph spaces, values and text

#### PART V Hypertension Clinic

A GP is seeing a patient who is being treated for hypertension. The GP checks the patient’s blood pressure and looks at their readings, which have been taken approximately every three months over the past three years.

For the last six months the patient has been taking a new regime of anti-hypertensive drugs.

The GP checks that the patient’s blood pressure is still within the target range, which it is, and that it is stable.

High Level Tasks  Read the current data values

 Check if the current data values fail to exceed or fall below a threshold

 Check for significant patterns over time in a series of data values

Potential Risks High:

 GP fails to see that the blood pressure has stabilised

 GP fails to see that the patient’s blood pressure readings are in the target range

Medium:

 Patient fails to understand the trend in their blood pressure readings

Possible consequence of risks: Incorrect treatment

Key Feature Areas Most Significant:

 Viewing trends and interactions, including interpolation

 Viewing data values in relation to normal ranges, targets and thresholds

Quite Significant:

 Intuitive and appropriate scaling

 Clear and appropriate axes

Reasonably Significant:

 Clear presentation of data values and units

Basic Practice:

 Appropriate layout, density and formatting of graph spaces, values and text
