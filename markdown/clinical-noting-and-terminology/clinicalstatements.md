# Executive Summary

**Problem**

  - SNOMED CT® encoded clinical statements do not have a standardised display
format and, as such, there is a lack of consistency in user interfaces and added potential for misinterpretation when viewing such statements

**Scope**

  - Perform groundwork for guidance to define display standards

**Headline Findings**

  - A need for significant education for the clinical community on benefits and
uses from creating SNOMED CT encoded structured records at point of care

  - Users prefer designs that minimise the repetition of data (for example, by
using headings to present common attributes)

  - Using standard SNOMED CT descriptions for modifiers and qualifiers for
example, ‘Known absent’ increases the risk of confusing users

  - The free-text annotations that cannot be captured in standard SNOMED CT
descriptions are often vital to understanding the true meaning of the statement, so users need to see and/or access that information

# Problem Statement

**The Problem**

  - SNOMED CT encoded clinical statements represented within the
Logical Record Architecture (LRA) do not have a standardised display format and, as such, there is a lack of consistency in user interfaces and added potential for misinterpretation when viewing such statements

**User Experience Goals**

  - Analyse common recording patterns defined in the LRA
documentation, matching these to the RCP Headings

  - Determine recommended methods and rules for the display of
those patterns

  - Provide consistent display rules for the components of a clinical
statement, such as dates, times, clinical terms and qualifiers

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 4

# Background for Investigation

**Background**

- Encoded clinical statements express information about a patient’s health record and provision of care

- SNOMED CT is a structured encoding system for health terms

- SNOMED CT terms are used in combination with the NHS LRA to provide a combined terminology and
information structure

**Logical Record Architecture (LRA)** The LRA is designed to allow better information sharing and based on international standards. It describes what data should be shared across multiple applications and how data will be managed, accessed and interpreted between independent information systems. The LRA includes early work on common patterns of clinical statements. Statement designs were tested based on these recording patterns, along with the standardised headings from the RCP Standards for Record Keeping project*. The two domains tested were admissions clerking and a summary presented as a chronological list.

**Recording** **patterns**

**Past medical history (PMH)** **Allergies, adverse reactions (AAR)**

**Past surgical history (PSH)** **History of current condition (HCC)**

**Family history (FH)** **Current medication (CM)**

**Medication history (MH)** **System review (SR)**

# Scope Statement

**In Scope**

   - Groundwork for future guidance on the display of encoded clinical statements for use in
delivery of clinical care

   - Sub-set of existing clinical statement ‘patterns’ with reference to the NHS LRA and
standardised headings from the Standards for Record Keeping work undertaken by the RCP

   - Indicating ability to interact with the encoded clinical statement:

       - For example, to view further associated information

       - The access to the edit mode for that statement

**Out of Scope**

   - Post coordinated SNOMED CT statements beyond those described in the LRA common
recording patterns

   - Sealed envelopes and other patient confidentiality issues

   - Demonstrating linkage of statements as defined within the LRA

   - Input of statements and/or encoding

   - Views for ‘clinical coders’

   - Multiple patient views

   - Patterns for treatment

   - Encoding for payment or other non-clinical purposes

# Patient Safety Overview

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-6-0.png)

The development lifecycle for this consultation document includes an integrated patient safety assessment and management process.

Known patient safety incidents relevant to this area have been researched and reviewed as part of ongoing development. A diverse set of clinical users were consulted during this process.

The Hazard Log records all the risks that have been identified during development and describes potential mitigatory actions that could be considered alongside future exploratory work in this area. The Hazard Log is a live document that will be updated as this area of work is developed further.

Until this work is progressed and developed to full design guide status it will not be in a position to achieve full Clinical Authority to Release (CATR) from the NHS Connecting for Health (CFH) Clinical Safety Group (CSG).

Please refer to [www.cui.nhs.uk for further information on the patient safety process and for the safety](http://www.cui.nhs.uk/) status and any relevant accompanying safety documentation for this consultation document.

# About this design consultation

The purpose of this Design Consultation document is to summarise the current learning that has been achieved in the design and research process to date. This is articulated primarily in terms of the features that comprise the preferred current design. Four key themes have emerged from these design features:

   - Statements

   - People, dates and headings

   - Visual design

   - Tasks

For each theme we summarise the design exploration and the feedback that came out of the studies. We will then summarise the emerging themes and proposed next steps for future exploration.

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 8

# Assumptions

Based on feedback from the NHS CUI project team and feedback from the Opening Risk Assessment (ORA), the following assumptions informed the designs and scenarios:

**1.** **Do not show the entire SNOMED CT expression with the term identifiers**

**2.** **Hide default values for context wrapper modifiers** for example, ‘subject of record’ defaults to patient, ‘finding context’ defaults to _known_ _present_, current/past defaults to _current_ **3.** **Do not use the phrase ‘SNOMED CT’ on screen,** for example, as a label, as this confuses users who currently have limited understanding of a) what that is and b) why it is useful to them

All scenarios tested were around the point of care and did not look at data validation or coding for payment scenarios. Users were given the following caveats about designs shown at the start of the risk assessments:

   - Fully SNOMED CT encoded records

   - Conforms to standardised records structure of the LRA and RCP Headings project

   - Records are shared

   - The same record can be viewed in multiple ways

   - There is a full electronic record

   - Access to the full record is quick and easy

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 9

Introduction to the design approach

One of the key areas of focus for this work was the relationship users had with the encoded terms and the additional free text that was not coded. Throughout the three phases of testing, different designs were shown that explored the display of encoded terms versus free text. Three key approaches were explored in multiple designs:

1. Repeat the encoded terms separately from the free text ( _**Repeated**_ )
2. Only show the encoded terms and have users click to reveal the additional free text ( _**Separated**_ )
3. Intelligently merge the encoded terms with the free text ( _**Unified**_ )

_**Repeated**_

_Showing the full statement in its unencoded state, with_
_the encoded clinical terms shown separately (that is,_
_repeated elsewhere in the design)_

##### Introduction to scenarios

Two common clinical scenarios were used in the testing, uncovering different aspects of displaying statements. Several designs were tested for both scenarios, with some common risks emerging.

**Scenario 1**

- **Single session, one clinician**

- **Typical scenario: Admissions clerking**

- **Organised by common headings**
This scenario showed all the statements from one session. All the statements shown had been entered at the same time, by the same person, for example during clerking

_One example design from this scenario:_

**Scenario 2**

- **Multiple sessions, multiple clinicians**

- **Typical scenario: Patient review**

- **Chronologically sorted**
This scenario dealt with a heterogeneous list of patterns, from different sessions. These had different authors, times, dates. The data was also more variable, for example, in some cases the statements were terse with only minimal information available

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 11

##### Introduction to the statement structure

These two designs illustrate how the different parts of the clinical statement can be assembled in the interface. These are not necessarily the recommended designs but both are good examples of how data structured using SNOMED CT and the LRA, together with the unencoded free text, should be presented in a unified and clear way.

##### Introduction to statements

This section examines how to present the statement components in a safe and usable way. Key areas of focus:

    - How to sequence the different parts of the statement to reduce risk of misinterpretation in the different scenarios

    - How to indicate the relationship between the free text and the encoded term

    - How best to present the encoded terms so users can read and understand them

    - How to present statements that do not have any encoding (unbound)
The text of the statement typically consists of three main parts:

    - The main encoded term (for example, _COPD)_

    - Additional free text (for example, _spiral, fell off ladder)_

    - Qualifiers and modifiers (for example, laterality and negation)

##### Statements – Perceptions of SNOMED CT

Design exploration and findings to date

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-15-2.png)

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-15-0.png)

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-15-1.png)

Users interviewed had an **ambivalent attitude** to SNOMED CT:

    - One user said that the need to see the data encoded structure correlated to their confidence levels in the system’s
accuracy, with low confidence driving an increased need to check There was some confusion or distrust over encoded statements generally:

    - Two users from the phone interviews had experienced issues with poor quality of encoding, with family history
conditions being wrongly attributed to the patient

    - It was usually cited as a way to get paid (which refers to different encoding, ICD-10/OPCS-4, for different purposes) but
highlights the general misconceptions in the users consulted Encoding of statements is **usually done by specialised teams:**

    - Either senior doctors or trained coders

    - Most interviewed had not done any encoding of statements themselves
Some users said they would want to **check their own encoding**

18 December 2009 Slide 16 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre

##### Statements – Free text and encoded clinical terms

Design exploration and findings to date 1

The visual relationship between the free text and the encoded clinical terms was tested over several sessions.

Three key approaches were explored in multiple design treatments:

   - Repeated

   - Separated

   - Unified

The optimum design from these findings appears to be Unified:

   - This made best use of screen space and
avoided unnecessary repetition

   - Differentiated font size between free text and
encoded terms was an elegant and nonobtrusive way to show the structure

   - This did not compromise the readability of the
statements

   - Additional controls to highlight encoded
clinical terms also seem to be useful to users, although not essential

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-16-0.png)

_**Repeated:**_ _Showing the full statement in its unencoded state, with the encoded_ _clinical terms shown separately (that is, repeated elsewhere in the design)_

_**Separated:**_ _Showing only the encoded clinical terms, with the user required to_ _request through a control viewing the additional free-text_

_**Unified:**_ _Extrapolating the encoded clinical terms and indicating what was the_ _additional free text that was not encoded but keeping them together to form a_ _single phrase of text that can still be read as one statement._

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 17

##### Statements – Free text and encoded clinical terms

Design exploration and findings to date 2

 - Unequivocal **preference for ‘friendly’ labels**, not a list of descriptions of modifiers and qualifiers:

     - For example, _No history of_ was always preferred to _Known absent, past_

     - This would require an interface terminology for axis modifiers

 - Showing only the encoded terms without the additional free text for a single statement was risky
because important clinical information could be missed

 - Users favoured seeing fewer repeated words from the encoding or the headings:

     - For example, **Family History** did not need to be repeated where there was a clear heading

 - Users preferred designs which used headings to group statements of the same pattern and infer
common meaning:

     - For example, **Family History** as this enabled dropping the subject modifier in the subsequent statements

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-18-3.png)

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-18-4.png)

This design shows only the encoded terms in first view:

   - User would have to click to see the full statement including narrative text

Users gave this design a low usability score due to the **due to the risk of missing critical unencoded** **information only recorded in the free text:**

   - For example, decreasing tolerance to exercise

This risk was increased for **unbound statements*** where no clinical information was visible in the first view ( _No associated terms..._ ) Users did express a **positive use** for a view showing encoded values only if used as a **validation** **screen** shown after inputting and encoding of statements (for example, by that same user)

_* Unbound statements are statements that have no SNOMED CT structure associated with them, consisting only of free text entered_
_by the clinical user_

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 19

##### Statements – Free text and encoded clinical terms

Design exploration and findings to date 4

A design was tested that displayed the list of encoded terms separately from the full statements list:

     - Some users did not like reading in two places

     - One user (junior doctor) identified using it as an
aid to get quickly up to speed with a long, verbose list, for example, History of Current Condition

It is not as effective where sections characteristically contain terse content:

     - For example, History sections

Generally, people preferred to see a **direct** **relationship and alignment** between the encoded terms and the free-text (for example, on the same line)

_This design displays the encoded terms in a_
_separate list that comes before the full statements_

##### Statements – Icons and graphical noting

Design exploration and findings to date 1

Bullet

Users felt it important to use **some kind of visual** **separator** between clinical term and additional free text. Some existing systems do this. Running text and code together could **create misleading statements**

**Pipes** [1] were visually liked but **carried risk of being** **misread as ‘1’**

**Dots** also well received, but **risk of being confused as** **a decimal point**

**Commas** initially preferred, but then discounted because of the risk of overlap with a comma used with as part of the SNOMED CT description. The same was true for hyphens

**More work is needed to identify a safe separator**

1 **Pipe** : a vertical bar separating data but indicating they are related

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-21-0.png)

_Users preferred to have a_ _**separating character,**_ _but all_ _those tested carried risk, so more work required to_ _identify a safe character_

##### Statements – Icons and graphical noting

Design exploration and findings to date 2

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-22-1.png)

_Users found the pen symbol distracting and_
_preferred not to have a graphic to indicate what_
_was free text_

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-22-0.png)

_Graphical noting was out of scope, however users_
_missed having these visual short cuts, particularly_
_when reviewing examinations and findings_

Users expressed a mixed reaction to the use of an icon to indicate text – most felt it was **distracting** and did not like the pen symbol

Many users did indicate a **desire to see graphical noting** (for example, to indicate left and right)

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 23

##### Statements – Icons and graphical noting

Design exploration and findings to date 3

In ‘ **Examinations and Findings** ’, users were used to reading information very quickly

Current practice has led to a **reliance on** **graphical noting** as a shorthand

Users reported skim reading the numbers:

     - “You know what the test is because the value
falls within a certain range”

     - Users requested to have deviation flagged in
some way (for example, colour or icons)

_Four of eight users wanted to see graphical noting_
_in the display of test results statements_

##### Statements – Unbound statements

Design exploration and findings to date

An unbound statement is a **statement without any encoding:**

     - For the phone interview, the unbound statement ‘Feeling strange’ was used because there is no exact match to a
SNOMED CT term. The subjectivity of it means it should not be altered. 'Feeling bad' or ‘Feeling groggy' are for example available, as is 'strange sensation‘

     - This was a good example as it highlighted the value of less precise, more subjective data

_Users liked the_
_flagging of no_
_encoding_

Most users (five of eight) thought ‘Feeling strange’ **a significant statement** as it was a valuable ‘clue’ or ‘prompt’ for the clinician. One thought it should appear first _No associated terms available_ was widely understood:

     - One user said that _No terms available_ would be clearer as _associated_ implied values such as duration, severity

Users liked the **colour** **and style differentiation** between _no terms_ message and an encoded term as this made it easier to spot

##### Statements – Axis modifiers

Design exploration and findings to date

_The sequence of words in the family history_
_statements minimises risk_

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-27-0.png)

_Word repetition is caused by the encoded_
_text and original text showing on the same_
_line. This led to confusion with the_
_suggestion of a double negative_

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-27-1.png)

Axis modifiers require careful sequencing in order to reduce risk of misinterpretation

Negation and Family History risk misinterpretation directly due to the sequence of the words:

   - _**Cancer – known absent**_ carries risk of being skim read as a positive statement; _**No cancer**_ is therefore safer

   - _**Family history of MI**_ is safer than _**MI – Family Hist**_ **ory** for the same reason

   - Showing Family History at the start of the statement is required in a mixed pattern list

   - If the list is only Family History statements then users are comfortable inferring that meaning from the heading

**As long as the axis modifier appeared before** the clinical focus term no additional emphasis was required, greater benefit came from having an interface terminology to make it **easy** to understand

**Designs which repeated words because both the original text and encoded statement were on the** **same line** risked causing confusion, particularly with negative statements:

   - The design shown above right confused users who read the terms and the free text together and thought it was a double
negative

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 28

##### Statements – Sequence of text

Design exploration and findings to date

In lists which show statements from different patterns, there is the risk that the user could misinterpret if default values, or some parts of statement, are hidden from view:

      - For example, there is a risk of confusing
Medication History with an Allergy to a Medication

      - In this design, both the Medication and
Allergy statements lead with the drug involved

      - This is unsafe because a user could skim
read and think that Penicillin is a current drug

The guidance should follow the published CUI guidelines and ensure that the allergy should always appear first, before the agent:

   - _[Design Guidance – Displaying Adverse](http://www.mscui.net/DesignGuide/DisplayingAllergies.aspx)_
_[Drug Reaction Risks](http://www.mscui.net/DesignGuide/DisplayingAllergies.aspx)_

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-28-0.png)

|**A negative statement should not lead with the clinical term.**<br>Negative statements should try to place the ‘no’ or ‘no history of’<br>before the key clinical term.|The risk is that if it does not appear before the clinical term, users<br>will skim down a list and just read the first word (for example,<br>‘Cancer – no history of’ is not acceptable because the user may<br>only see the first word of the statement).<br>There are some statements into which the negative term for<br>example, (_no, not, no history of_) cannot be easily inserted. An<br>example of this is:<br>_O/E –  oedema  –  absent_<br>**_Future work:_**The ideal solution would be to identify any<br>common statement wordings such as ‘on examination’ and<br>create rules to insert the negation in the correct place in the<br>sequence. For example:<br>_On examination – no oedema_<br>_No oedema on examination_|
|**Family history should always be shown in front of the statement**<br>**in a mixed pattern setting**|The risk is that users will skim down a list and just read the first<br>word (for example, ‘MI – family history’)<br>|

##### Statements – Related statements

Design exploration and findings to date

_Users were confused by_
_these family history_
_statements and could not_
_tell if they were linked_
_and therefore significant_

**Demonstrating a user interface for linked statements was out of scope.** However, there was a **consistent demand** and **need** to see these relationships represented in all of the user sessions

**Failing to visually link related statements** to make their connection obvious to the user was raised as a significant risk in interpreting the data correctly:

     - In the design above it was unclear that the father’s death was caused by IHD, which could **lead to misinterpretation** or distrust

## THEME 2 – PEOPLE, DATES AND HEADINGS

Introduction to people, dates and headings Dates and times People Visual hierarchy and headings

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 33

##### Introduction to people, dates and headings

This section looks at the parts of a statement other than SNOMED CT terms and free text. These elements aid users’ comprehension. Their relative importance in the display is driven by the scenario. This section includes:

   - People, dates and times, including the risk of confusion over what role the person has had, session versus
observation dates and formatting of dates

   - Using headings to group statements with common attributes to remove both repetition and redundant attributes
from each statement

   - The risks associated with scrolling, particularly when headings represent common attributes

   - The appropriate visual structure for each of the tested clinical scenarios

##### People, dates and headings

Design exploration and findings to date

Confusion over **session time** versus **observation time** was common. Users were **confused by multiple** **columns** of dates that presented both on screen:

     - _**Session time**_ _,_ the period when the clinical encounter occurred and the records were created

     - _**Observation time**_ _,_ the time the observation was made, or the clinically relevant time

     - They are both Intervals, so they can have a start and end time

Confusion with people, particularly over **author** versus **care provider** was also common:

     - General assumption that, in the scenarios shown, the care provider was also the author

Dates and people information **increases in importance and value** in certain situations:

     - When editing something

     - In fast-paced environments where many people are seeing the patient

     - When something goes wrong (there are legalities around the exact time something happened or was recorded)

Users did not expect to see it in a primary or default view, particularly for history statements

Users like to have dates and people as **something they can display as required**

The scenarios tested influenced the user’s need to see date/author **for every individual statement:**

     - In an admissions clerking scenario, users were “irritated” by date/people information being repeated for every statement

     - In these scenarios, the preference was to have the date/people information available at a higher (composition) level

     - In views where statements have come from more than one session or composition, so that there are multiple people and dates,
the need to show this information at statement level increases

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 35

##### People, dates and headings – Dates and times

Design exploration and findings to date 1

_Multiple dates per statement_
_were confusing._

_Users did favour having a less_
_granular display for older_
_items. Entries from yesterday_
_(13 October) do not show the_
_time, compared to those from_
_today (14 October) which do._

Clinicians need to have access to both session time/date and observation time:

       - They do not expect to see both on the screen at the same time and displaying multiple dates in the same view (as above)
caused confusion, even with labelling

Optimum format of date and time varies depending on situation:

       - The exact times (observation and session) are more critical the faster paced environment you are in (for example, an acute
admissions unit where minutes are significant)

       - Users favoured designs that had different date formats for more recent entries (for example, down to the minute, versus
just day or month level reporting for older items)

       - Appropriate date granularity will vary; the important point is that the system should reflect the accuracy of the date as
captured, in line with existing CUI guidance:

          - _[Design Guidance – Date Display](http://www.mscui.net/DesignGuide/DateDisplay.aspx)_

          - _[Design Guidance – Time Display](http://www.mscui.net/DesignGuide/TimeDisplay.aspx)_

##### People, dates and headings – Dates and times

Design exploration and findings to date 2

Position of the date field affected readability of the list:

        - Users preferred designs where the date appeared to the left of the statement

        - This was particularly important for historical items (and helped differentiate items in the past from current conditions,
as in the design above)

##### People, dates and headings – Dates and times

Design exploration and findings to date 3

_Extracting the word_
_‘Past’ from the_
_pattern name (Past_
_Medical History)_
_caused confusion_
_about whether a_
_condition might still_
_be ongoing_

Users **struggled to construct a full story** over time from a single date or time heading

**Using a label of ‘Past' for the pattern Past Medical History caused misinterpretation:**

      - Users thought this meant that a problem no longer existed and was either cured or not active

      - Although statements are shown under Past Medical History the condition itself may still be current or an ongoing problem

Users were not sure whether something was **still a problem and over what time period:**

      - A timeline based view of statements is one way this could be addressed and needs further investigation

      - Further work is also advised on how to represent duration or end dates through text

##### People, dates and headings – Dates and times

Design exploration and findings to date 4

_This search engine_
_style design was_
_popular with users_
_wanting to scan a_
_historical set of_
_statements_

In the phone-based assessment, users preferred search-engine style interfaces:

      - This design showed multiple attributes flowing together on a subsidiary line (for example, date, time, person and location)

      - Clinical terms are displayed as ‘keywords’ that pull out the key information associated with that statement (mimicking social
sites where keywords or ‘tags’ are shown alongside articles)

In a later risk assessment, users preferred not to see time/author information at a statement level:

      - More work is recommended on this type of design, specifically if it is an effective way of handling multiple session/pattern lists
which makes economical use of screen real estate

##### People, dates and headings – People

Design exploration and findings to date

Users want access to the data about people associated with an entry (for example, the author or responsible clinician) but **do not** **expect it to appear on every entry in the** **default view:**

      - Having information about people in the default view
created **additional clutter** which made lists of statements harder to read

**Role and location** were other fields that users would like to have accessible

Users thought **querying by role** would be useful (for example, a view where you could click on their name and see all statements associated with them)

It should be made clear whether the name displayed is the **author** of the entry **or the** **responsible clinician**

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-42-0.png)

_default (as seen above) but would want to be able to_

People, dates and headings – Visual hierarchy and headings

Design exploration and findings to date 1

Users were able to deduce the meaning of the statements implied by the headings:

        - For example, Family History statements were
correctly identified in the design above left

        - This was reliant on the headings being well
defined and clearly visually associated with the statements

Where headings were clear, users preferred **not** to see the heading repeated with the statements

_In this design above, users used the headings to deduce the_
_meaning of the statements_

_This design (right) was_ _**not**_ _preferred as it was_ _harder to read and more cluttered from_ _repeating the contextual label (family history)_

People, dates and headings – Visual hierarchy and headings

Design exploration and findings to date 2

**Scenario one** showed **all the statements from one** **session**   - so all at the same time by the same person:

      - Here there is a clear desire from users to have them grouped

      - All statements of the same pattern pulled under one heading

      - This allows all the common attributes of the pattern to be in
embedded in the heading

      - This approach is liked by users because it makes economical
use of the space by reducing the need to repeat information at the statement level

Using a header is an effective way of showing common information

Users liked these type of designs because the strong hierarchy made them easier to read:

   - Use of headings and sub headings to group similar statements
together

   - Users liked to see colour and font differentiation between
headings and statements

   - Indenting the statements under the headings improved
comprehension and mirrors paper based note taking

Line spacing aids reading flow:

   - Close vertical line spacing shown here aided readability too –
users could read the blocks of text ‘as a story’

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-45-0.png)

_Users found designs with a clear hierarchy_
_easier to use, possible because they closely_
_match paper systems_

People, dates and headings – Visual hierarchy and headings

Design exploration and findings to date 3

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-46-0.png)

_This design positioned the pattern name after the_
_clinical terms, user found this hard to read and_
_there was a risk of wrongly associating the pattern_
_name with the next statement_

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-46-1.png)

_Positioning the pattern name after or away (separate column)_
_from the focus clinical terms was confusing to users and_
_risked being overlooked or misread_

These designs both addressed scenario two (multiple pattern, multiple sessions), with different authors, times, dates:

   - This presented more challenges as users needed to see more of the contextual information at the statement level

   - Several designs were tested, including columnar designs and search-engine style, where information is displayed below the
statement (top right)

Position of the contextual information (for example, pattern name) is key to user’s understanding:

   - A clear theme was that the pattern names for example, Family History, are important to keep with the statement

   - This information needs to be positioned so as not to be missed or ignored – ideally before the clinical terms

   - Placing it after the clinical term, or in a separate column, risked confusion or being overlooked

   - Users expected to read this first as it was key part of understanding the statement

   - Line spacing is important between statements to avoid the user incorrectly associating heading with statement when the
heading appears after the statement. A mitigation here would be use of a background banding

People, dates and headings – Visual hierarchy and headings

Design exploration and findings to date 4

Main design risk here is if the **heading** **is carrying important axis modifiers,** **and scrolls out of view, the user loses** **important contextual information:**

      - For example, the person it applies to
(subject of record)

Users were **not keen to have to scroll** to different parts of the record:

      - For example, the user might expect surgical
history to be part of the PMH so would not necessarily scroll down to find it in another section

      - Risk that clinician is not focusing on the
scroll bar but is focusing on reading the data and may miss the scroll bar.

There could be an assumption that the **information lower down is less** **interesting** and less of a priority

## THEME 3 – VISUAL DESIGN

Introduction to Visual Design Formatting of statements Tables and columns

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 52

##### Introduction to Visual design

This section looks at the visual representation of a statement and investigates which designs are safest and easiest to read:

   - Users’ preferences for the presentation of free text and encoded terms

   - Designs that help to indicate a visual structure, such as the presentation of headings

   - Use of icons and graphics

   - Using tables and columns to provide structure

##### Visual Design – Formatting of statements

Design exploration and findings to date 1

There was a preference to have **visual** **differentiation between encoded statements and** **free text** . Most felt it would be too flat and dense if all the same:

   - For example, use colour and size

**Users liked indenting statements** below headings, good sense of hierarchy and connection between statement and title:

   - This also mirrors clinicians’ note taking on paper, so feels more
familiar to users

**No real strong winner on banding,** some like background shading, others said it did not add that much

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-53-0.png)

_Differentiate with colour and font size_

_Indentation was liked_

_No strong preference for banding_

_Showing encoded terms in bold encouraged skim_
_reading which could lead to information being_
_overlooked_

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-54-1.png)

_Users were confused by the use of inline italics_
_to denote encoded attributes_

**Inline formatting was distracting** and made no difference to comprehension

**Users found it easier to read encoded statements rendered as plain text** with no formatting

**Inline formatting increased the risk of skim reading**, leading to users overlooking important (unencoded) words

##### Visual Design – Formatting of statements

Design exploration and findings to date 3

_In this design, users can opt to_
_highlight the encoded terms if_
_required_

Users **did not see a clear need** to **frequently** augment the visual display of the encoded clinical terms:

      - For example, through highlighting with colour

However, where the user is performing encoding validation, a design where highlighting could be switched on or off was liked

_In this design, the encoded_
_terms and additional free-text_
_are assembled to form a_
_statement with no inline_
_repetition – this was liked_

_An additional column can be_
_requested by the users to see_

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-56-4.png)

![](clinicalstatements_assets/clinicalstatements.pdf-56-5.png)

This design was effective at combining encoded terms and additional free text in a way that supported readability and reduced unnecessary repetition:

   - The ability to add into view an ‘encoded terms only’ column was liked as it was easy to scan and to see where encoded clinical
terms were missing

   - Providing a visual differentiation through font size between encoded terms and free text was liked

   - In this design the background cell colour and key lines helped link the encoded clinical terms with the statements

##### Visual Design – Formatting of statements

Design exploration and findings to date 5

_Both of these designs were liked by users – easy to read as a statement but also easy to see what was an encoded_
_clinical terms and additional free-text. The difference between them is the separating character (a pipe or a dot)_

Designs were preferred which **differentiated encoded clinical terms from user entered additional** **free-text**

**Font size was the best way** of doing this **without disrupting reading flow**

**A separating character was preferred**, but a risk-free character has not been identified

##### Visual Design – Formatting of statements

|Emerging themes|Evidence|
|---|---|
|**Minimise inline formatting, such as bold**<br>**or italics**|Users find it harder to read and comprehend statements with inline formatting|
|**Users like to be in control of highlighting**<br>**or picking out the encoded clinical terms**<br>(for example, through highlighting or<br>adding an additional column)|Users do not see a clear need to know which are encoded clinical terms, so having a<br>control to allow them to highlight or separate them out (for example, in a separate<br>column) is more likely to meet user need.<br>Specific scenarios, such as data validation after data input or checking data, would lend<br>themselves to this kind of control|
|**Font size is an effective and non-**<br>**disruptive differentiator between**<br>**encoded clinical terms and free-text**|Users were favourable towards designs that used a subtle difference in point size<br>between encoded clinical terms and additional free-text<br>The point size difference should not prevent users from scanning both types of data in a<br>single statement. Size difference is not prescriptive, based on the designs tested, a gap<br>of around 4 points created enough differentiation but avoided acute visual disruption|
|**Banding helps users scanning in tabular**<br>**designs and reduces risk in multiple-line**<br>**statement designs**|**_Phone interviews:_** Slight preference with the banding<br>**_Third risk assessment:_**A stronger preference emerged because of the risk of wrongly<br>attributing a pattern name if the line spacing was not clearly designed, or even just<br>equidistant between all statements.|
|**_Future work:_Separator characters are**<br>**thought to be a useful device, but more**<br>**work is required on what is a safe device**<br>**and the exact representation of numerical**<br>**data in an encoded statement**|**_Third risk assessment:_**Users felt that all the characters used could be confused with<br>numerical readings<br>However, this needs more validation as the examples shown had numerical data<br>incorrectly displayed as free-text where there would actually be encoded values, so this<br>risk may not be true|

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 59

##### Visual Design – Tables and columns

Design exploration and findings to date 1

_Examples of compound columns. Multiple data fields are positioned in close proximity to make best use of space (for_
_example, date, time, author and location): good for multi-pattern, multi-session based lists (scenario two)_

**Two columns appeared to be the optimum number that users liked to read:**

     - More than two columns scored lower as ‘busy’

     - Fewer columns enabled a wider content column where the main statement text would not wrap or truncate, which users
preferred. They wanted to have as much room as possible for the most important content: the clinical terms and free-text

**Compound columns** are a useful device to present multiple data fields in small space

**Compound columns are effective for multi-pattern, multi-session type lists** with more fields of contextual information at the statement level:

     - For scenario one, simple columns were sufficient to show the amount of data required because headings could be used to
group related statements, and the date and author information could be presented once at the composition level

     - Some users were comfortable processing multiple fields in the same column, but this feedback was inconsistent and in the
last session users found this type of design visually cluttered

##### Visual Design – Tables and columns

Design exploration and findings to date 2

Clinical statements that contained observable entities and values – **examinations and findings**

  - were tested. Users **were familiar with**
**processing information very quickly** with **very** **little need to actually read** the full statement

**Unanimous preference for columns** here:

     - Users found it easier to scan down the test values
because they were not merged in with the test description

     - Skim reading the numbers (you know what the test is
because the value falls within a certain range)

Users wanted to **see similar tests grouped** **together:**

     - For example, all the abdominal tests, CVS, and so on

_Users preferred values in columns, and would have_
_liked to see headings to group similar tests as this_
_would be easier to read_

18 December 2009 Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre Slide 63

##### Introduction to tasks

This section looks at how the design may need to change depending on the task being performed Some tasks may lend themselves to different designs, for example, a clinician:

   - In acute care who needs to understand the immediate problems of a patient

   - Reviewing a patient’s past history collated from multiple sources

   - Reviewing a set of examination results

   - Who has seen a mistake in the encoded terms and wants to change it

   - Who is validating the encoded terms for statements they have created

##### Tasks – Spotting mistakes

Design exploration and findings to date

_In this design, the encoded terms are for the second statement do not match the_
_full free text._

Only one user spotted the data discrepancy unprompted

One user was confused by ‘No’ and thought it meant ‘Number’

Most users understood once prompted but admitted they would not check in real life

They did not feel responsible for the accuracy of the encoded clinical terms

Many clinicians incorrectly assumed that other people are employed to do the encoding of clinical terms and that it was not within the remit of the clinician to do it, or care about it:

       - A common myth amongst users was that SNOMED CT encoding was the same as that done for payment (ICD-10/OPCS-4)

##### Tasks – Editing

Design exploration and findings to date

No strong preference to click inline to edit or use a button

All users agreed there needed to be validation and wanted to understand the auditing and version control process:

    - Date/author/change information was important at this point
for the auditing reasons

Users like to see a visual differentiation between the edit mode and display mode:

    - For example, a border or colour

All expected to be able to edit both code and free text

Users were more comfortable when there was a label above the fields being edited

No one understood ‘View all fields’ for editing the default values

_Inline editing was liked for_
_its fewer clicks, but concerns_
_about editing by mistake or_
_not realising you could edit_

_Users liked the different colour and form field labels_
_that differentiated the statement in edit mode_

Who entered something (their role, seniority)<br>has influence.”<br>**_“_**Date/author information important in edit mode, audit trail”<br>“Concerns about change control, original entry should be locked down, if done by someone else or at<br>a different time. If you are editing in session then you should be able to go back in and adjust the<br>original entry.”<br>“Concerns over the versioning, should you really be able to edit someone else's statement?”|
|**_Future work:_Different ways**<br>**to indicate access to editing**<br>**default values**|Users were not very clear on what other fields might be available to edit, and this was linked with<br>their low understanding of SNOMED CT and the concept of default values such as subject of record<br>**_Phone interview: “_**Not sure what See All fields means or does”|

So need some form of confirmation<br>before change is made, or turn off for novice users”<br>“Not preferred, likes the certainty of having to request to edit e.g. Via a button. (although this could<br>be handled through confirmation on submit)”<br>“Not preferred, likes the certainty of an edit button”<br>“Looks like an admin screen, might use in a training, supervisory or auditing reporting capacity, but<br>not clinical. Big leap from current practice/thinking”<br>“Poorer editing experience, would not expect to click on statement and have it become editable, this<br>would need to be learned. Expects to have to initiate the action e.g. Clicking an edit button. Risk that<br>you could accidentally edit something by leaning on the keyboard.”|

##### Tasks – View controls

Design exploration and findings to date

_Users liked the ability to add more data into_
_view as needed_

_Most users understood the plus sign as an_
_expand control. Expected to see fuller detail_
_(not terse encoded clinical terms)_

Users like to feel in control, so the ability to add fields to views as needed was popular

‘Plus’ expand control – six of eight users understood it

However, all users thought it would expand to a fuller description and were surprised/disappointed to see a terse set of codes

### Tasks – View controls

|Emerging themes|Evidence|
|---|---|
|**Avoid using an expansion**<br>**control for revealing only the**<br>**encoded terms as this is not**<br>**expected behaviour – users**<br>**want to see fuller detail**|**_Phone interviews:_**“Expects this to expand, " a tree view", folder structure, to reveal more<br>information. More information includes more verbose text, related statements”<br>“Expects the + sign to expand to show full (more verbose) information, or linked statements e.g.<br>Onset. Indicates a hierarchy, waterfall”<br>“Dated design. Expects to see more information, longer narrative e.g. The story behind the<br>headline”.<br>“Expectation is that the plus sign indicates more information, more detail e.g.<br>Date/author/coding. Maybe more verbose, not sure.”<br>“If date/author was part of expanded view could be helpful”<br>“Assumes will expand to show more information, specific to this patient. Fuller information”|
|**Using a plus sign as an**<br>**expansion control may cause**<br>**confusion with some users**<br>**when used with a negative**<br>**statement**|Mitigation for this would be to ensure that the visual treatment made it look like a control and<br>not a data item**.**<br>**_Phone interviews:_**“Odd to use a plus sign next to a negative statement. Thinks the plus sign is an<br>icon, not a control.”<br>“Confusing to have a plus sign next to a negative”|
|**_Future work:_use of controls to**<br>**show linked statements or more**<br>**detail**|Detailed exploration of view controls was out of scope, so more investigation into best ways of<br>controlling views would be needed (or use past guidance)|
|**_Future work:_different**<br>**approaches to changing view**<br>**levels**|Detailed exploration of view controls was out of scope, so more investigation into best ways of<br>controlling views would be needed (or use past guidance)<br>|

#### Future work summary

|Area|Questions for future work|
|---|---|
|**Encoded terms**|What scenarios would favour showing encoded terms in isolation from free text?|
|<br>**Graphics and icons**|Exploration of noting using graphics recommended, particularly for examination and findings|
|<br>**Graphics and icons**|What is a safe character that can be used between code and free text?|
|**Unbound statements**|Guidelines/policies for clinicians on when statements should be encoded, versus left unbound. Test assumptions – are any/all statements to be<br>encoded, including all ward notes? Or just those which are ‘significant’ – in which case, what are the rules for deciding this?|
|**Related statements**|Test interfaces which allow users to group and view links between related statements|
|**Date/time**|More work required on how users expect to view and interact with session times versus observation time|
|**Date/time**|What is the best way to show duration through text and timeline views|
|**Hierarchy**|Do all users find it harder to construct a care story using statements from multiple sessions and multiple patterns? What can be done with<br>different views (for example, timeline) to help with this?|
|**Hierarchy**|How do users navigate through records with many entries|
|**Hierarchy**|What usage scenarios support showing SNOMED CT only in a separate list from the full, verbose statement|
|**Formatting**|Separator characters are thought to be a useful device, but more work is required on what is a safe device and the exact representation of<br>numerical data in an encoded statement|
|**Tables**|Test effectiveness of having date and author line below the statement|
|**Spotting mistakes**|Test an end-to-end scenario where users encode the clinical terms and then view the encoded statements so that they feel more ownership<br>over the encoded terms|
|**Spotting mistakes**|More work required on flagging of discrepancies between the original statement and the encoded terms|
|**Spotting mistakes**|More intelligent systems are required to cross check free text against encoding and then flag issues|
|**Editing**|Different ways to indicate access to editing default values|
|**Editing**|Do users understand and expect inline editing, as opposed to button based access|
|**View controls**|Use of controls to show linked statements or more detail|
|**View controls**|Different approaches to changing view levels|
