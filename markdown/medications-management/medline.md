**Patient Safety Process**
The development cycle for this design guide is compliant with the Clinical Safety Management System (CSMS) – the patient safety risk assessment and management process defined by NHS Connecting for Health (NHS CFH) in conjunction with the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA).
The design guide developers reviewed patient safety incidents arising from both current practice and existing systems for medications management. The resulting guidance points support mitigation of these known patient safety risks. In addition, the developers identified any potential new risks by applying a patient-safety risk-assessment process. The developers are assessing and managing all risks to support a Clinical Safety Case for this design guide.
The Hazard Log records all hazards and risks raised to date and includes mitigation actions that, in some cases, will be applicable to you if you are an implementer or other user of this design guide. The Hazard Log is a live document and updates regularly whilst this design guide continues its development. Until this design guide has received full Clinical Authority to Release (CATR) from the NHS CFH Clinical Safety Group (CSG) – based on an approved Clinical Safety Case – there may be outstanding patient safety risks yet to be identified and mitigated. Therefore, it is essential that you review the relevant Hazard Log in conjunction with this design guide.
Refer to nww.cui.nhs.uk (N3 connection required) for all current patient safety documentation, including Hazard Logs and the current patient safety process status for this and other design guides.

### 1 INTRODUCTION

This document provides guidance for the representation of a medication in a user interface (UI). It describes the area of focus, lists mandatory and recommended guidance points with usage examples and explains the rationale behind the guidance.

This document replaces the previously published guidance _Medications Management – Medication_ _Line_ **{R1}** . It has been extended to provide formatting and layout rules that add structure and consistency to the way that medications are displayed in a user interface.

Table 1 describes the changes made since the previous version of this document:

![](medline_assets/medline.pdf-3-0.png)

1.0.0.0 28-Mar-2008 The following table summarises updates that have been made to this document:

**Deleted** :

 MEDi-006 deleted to remove constraint to UK or NHS standards

**Modified** :

 MEDi-002 includes additional information that cites exceptions in which capital letters can be

used in a generic drug name

 MEDi-004 has been split into MEDi-023 and MEDi-026. These two guidance points are listed in

separate sections to provide more detailed guidance for truncation and abbreviation respectively

 MEDi-005 has been split into MEDi-018 and MEDi-027. These two guidance points are listed in

separate sections to provide more detailed guidance for separators and symbols respectively

 MEDi-007 has been updated to mandate the use of the word ‘DOSE’ in a text label for a dose

value

 MEDI-010, MEDi-011 and MEDi-012 have been reworded to clarify the guidance

**Added** :

 A further 42 guidance points, MEDi-013 to MEDi-054, have been added. Refer to section 2.1 for

more details

Table 1: Changes Since the Last Baseline Version

**Note**

In this document, the words ‘generic’ and ‘brand’, when associated with drug names, are used with very specific meanings that may differ from their accepted meanings in other contexts. Refer to section 4.2 for definitions of the specific terminology used in this document.

#### 1.1 Customer Need

An electronic – system for managing a patient’s medications must be able to support the complex needs of a wide range of health care professions and health care settings. A successful display solution must therefore balance those complex information needs with safety concerns, and ensure consistency across views and between systems.

**Medications Incidents**  - The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) reports that the majority of medication incidents reported between January 2005 and June 2006 related to the administration of medicines (59.3 percent), followed by incidents related to the preparation and dispensing of medications (17.8 percent) and the prescribing of medications (15.7 percent). Their findings, documented in _Safety in doses: medication safety incidents in the NHS_ _[1]_, also state that the most

common types of medication incidents reported to the NSPA included incorrect dose, incorrect strength or frequency, omitted medicine and wrong medicine.

**Existing Systems**  - In-patient hospital care settings currently use multiple kinds of medications documents, both paper-based and electronic. As care professionals move between hospitals and are faced with new information groupings while working in stressful environments, the differences in the designs of the documents they use may well already impact patient safety. Differences in display formats for medicines impact both the review and management of those medications and will become a safety concern as electronic systems become more widely available in the next few years. The challenge for designers developing electronic systems in this area is particularly great as there are no universally-accepted paper-based standards to reference.

Research in which extensive studies of medication-related errors were reviewed, suggests that the most powerful means of preventing medication-related errors are computerised order entry and administration management along with standards for processes and for the writing of prescriptions (see _Medication Errors_ **{R3}**, _To Err Is Human_ **{R4}** and _Understanding Patient Safety_ **{R5}** ).

Anecdotal references to medication errors most frequently describe problems with legibility of handwritten scripts, the use of abbreviations, translation errors in verbal communications and mistakes exacerbated by similar looking bottles or product labels and similar looking or similar sounding drug names. These well-documented errors focus on specific elements of a medication order, as do the means by which we mitigate them. In addition to these specific errors, there is a need to ensure that medications orders are more thorough in terms of the information they contain, and that they are created, structured, displayed and communicated in a consistent way. Mitigations of this kind may also address the specific errors described above, by providing additional information in a medication order in a way that leaves less room for misinterpretation.

#### 1.2 Scope

This guidance has been designed for the display of medications for a single patient in a hospital ward environment. The guidance applies to the display of the details of a medication including drug name, strength, form, dose, route and frequency. The additional information about medication required for safe medication management, review and modification is out of scope.

##### 1.2.1 In Scope

The guidance in this document covers the following features:

- Line item display rules:

 Generic rules for the display of medication including wrapping, truncation, abbreviation, spacing, fonts formatting and labelling

The following users are covered in this guidance:

- Doctors and other independent prescribers

- Nurses with responsibility for medicines administration

- Pharmacists

The following care settings are covered in this guidance:

- Inpatient

The following medications are covered in this guidance:

- Oral solids and liquids

- Inhalers and sprays

- Eye, ear and nose drops

- Topical liquids

- Creams, ointments and gels

- Enemas and rectal solutions

- Granules and powders

- Suppositories and pessaries

- Topical patches

- Nebuliser solutions

- Simple infusions (by example only)

- Injections (insulin example only)

- Unlicensed medications

##### 1.2.2 Out of Scope

Although there may be specific risks associated with the out of scope areas that are not addressed in this guidance, it is likely that the principles in this guidance will extend to the display of medication information in many of the areas listed below.

The following features are not covered in this guidance:

- The display of all information about a single medication:

 Guidance for the layout and structure for the presentation of ‘all’ information for one medication from the selection of a medication anywhere in a clinical application

- Identity of a medication:

 Definition of which attributes can be changed without the need for a new medication line to be created (in the UI)

The following users are not covered in this guidance:

- Other health care professionals

- Senior nurse (for ward management and multi-patient tasks)

- Non-clinical staff

- Patient

**Note**

The patient is out of scope because the guidance is designed to support user interfaces used by clinicians. As such, it will therefore present information in formats that are designed to support health care professionals. The display of medication information in views that are designed for patients is not addressed in this guidance.

The following care settings are not covered in this guidance:

- Outpatients

- Clinics

- Pharmacies

- Emergency services and departments

#### 1.3 Dependencies

**D1** This guidance is informed by ongoing and unpublished work by the NHS National Programme for IT (NPfIT) that is referred to in this document as NHS Connecting for Health (NHS CFH) Medication Types Rules. The NHS CFH Medication Types Rules is still evolving and is based on extensive research and consultation. Changes to this work will trigger changes to this guidance.

**D2** The guidance points in section 3.3.1 are particularly dependent on research into the application of Tallman lettering, as documented by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) in _How should Tallman lettering be applied to look-_ _alike/sound-alike drug name pairs?_ _[2]_. In summary, Tallman lettering is a proposed solution for mitigating the risks of ‘lookalike, sound-alike’ drug names. Tallman lettering is mandated in the US and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in _Look-Alike Sound-Alike Medication Names_ _[3]_. The uptake of Tallman lettering in electronic prescribing in the UK would require a review of the use of capital letters for differentiating brand names, and is currently the subject of an ongoing NHS CFH research project.

**D3** This guidance is informed by the NHS CFH _ePrescribing Functional Specification_ _[4]_.

**D4** This guidance uses the concepts ‘generic drug’ and ‘brand name’ and depends on access to, or creation of, a database or dictionary, that can support these concepts, such as the _Dictionary of Medicines and Devices_ (known as ‘dm+d’) [5].

### 2 GUIDANCE OVERVIEW

When a medication is prescribed, a series of choices are made about the type of medication and the way in which it is to be administered. Assuming that the prescribing and administration of a medication is recorded electronically, those choices are then represented in various degrees of detail and in different areas of a user interface. For example, a summary of the prescription might be displayed in a patient summary, a more detailed set of information might be displayed in a list of that patient’s current medications and a different set of detailed information might be displayed in an electronic drug administration schedule.

The details that are displayed on the screen, as well as the formatting and layout applied to them, will vary depending on the purpose of the part of the clinical application in which they are being displayed. Some views will show medications information in text while others will show some of that information encoded visually. A text description of a medication in any of these views is referred to in guidance as a ‘medication line’.

Guidance for two medication views, _Medications Management – Medication View_ **{R10}** and _Medications Management – Drug Administration_ **{R11}**, define specific layout and details for the display of medication information in those views. The guidance in this document includes layout and formatting details that apply to all views that are designed to support medications management for a single patient in a hospital ward.

It is likely that many of the principles in this guidance will extend to the display of medication information in all areas of a clinical application.

Figure 1 illustrates how the guidance can be applied to four different styles of medication line in four notional views:

**diltiazem**                   - CALCICARD CR – modified-release tablet – **`DOSE`** **120 mg**                   - oral – three times a day

### 3 GUIDANCE DETAILS

#### 3.1 Introduction

This section contains detailed guidance for the display of a medication that has been prescribed for a single patient.

#### 3.2 Principles

The following key principles inform the guidance in this section:

- Minimise visual clutter so that formatting and icons are effective for providing emphasis and

implying priorities: draw attention to important information without introducing too much distraction

- Support legibility through the use of font, line spacing, and letter spacing and other proven

mechanisms

- Define rules to support standard display of medications information wherever possible

whilst allowing flexibility for information to be displayed appropriately for different tasks

The ISMP’s _Draft Guidelines for Safe Electronic Communication of Medication Orders_ _[15]_ and NHS CFH’s _ePrescribing Functional_ _Specification_ **{R8}** and _Guidelines for the Design and Presentation of Medication Elements Required in Electronic Prescribing or_ _Medication Ordering Systems_ **{R24}**, have recommendations and guidelines that advise the use of lowercase letters for generic names and uppercase letters for brand names.

The WHO’s publication _Look-Alike, Sound-Alike Medication Names_ **{R7}** provides advice on mitigating the risks of look-alike, soundalike medication names. Their description of the problem and associated issues includes reference to the potential for confusion between generic and brand names. Their related suggested action is to:

“…include both the non-proprietary name and the brand name of the medication on medication orders and labels, with the nonproprietary name in proximity to, and in larger font size than the brand name.”

In this document, generic names are shown in bold lowercase and brand names in title case italics.

Guidance is supported by the prevalence of an emerging convention in which generic drug names are displayed in lowercase. Guidance also follows one of a few commonly used conventions for displaying brand names. It thus aims to introduce consistency and achieve the benefits described above whilst minimising the impact of potential conflict with existing conventions.

#### 3.4 Rationale Summary

This section summarises the principles behind the rationale for all guidance points in this document.

General Principles:

- Provide support for legibility

- Mitigate risks of incorrect selection and mis-interpretation

Usability Principles:

- Minimise the use of embellishments (for example, bold, colour, fonts, font sizes, italics,

separators and symbols)

- Minimise instances of each type of embellishment within a reading unit

- Consistent use of specific embellishments within and preferably between user-interface

contexts or ‘views’

- Use words instead of symbols where it is important for removing ambiguity

Existing Standards:

- NHS CFH – _ePrescribing Functional Specification_ **{R8}**

- NHS NPfIT – _Guidelines for the Design and Presentation of Medication Elements Required_

_in Electronic Prescribing or Medication Ordering Systems_ **{R24}**

- ISMP (US) – _Draft Guidelines for Safe Electronic Communication of Medication_

_Orders_ **{R23}**

Evolving Standards:

- NHS NPfIT – _Types of medication item for display and prescribing within Secondary Care_

_electronic systems_ **{R32}**

#### 4.2 Definitions

NHS Entity Within this document, defined as a single NHS organisation or group that is operated within a single technical infrastructure environment by a defined group of IT administrators.

The Authority The organisation implementing the NHS National Programme for IT (currently NHS Connecting for Health).

Current best practice Current best practice is used rather than best practice, as over time best practice guidance may change or be revised due to changes to products, changes in technology, or simply the additional field deployment experience that comes over time.

Generic drug name This can be a single drug name that refers to a single active ingredient or it can be multiple active ingredients that are prescribed as one drug. In the structure of the dm+d **{R9}**, this generally equates to a Virtual Therapeutic Moiety (VTM).

**Important Note**

This definition is for this document only and may not reflect the definitions that are used in clinical practice or healthcare organisations.

Brand name A brand name for a product containing medication. A brand name may be associated with many products. In some cases, the same brand name may be associated with different generic drugs. Future versions of the dm+d **{R9}** are expected to include a separate entity for brand name, known as Trade Family Name (TFN). In the meantime, the brand name is part of the Actual Medicinal Product (AMP).

**Important Note**

This definition is for this document only and may not reflect the definitions that are used in clinical practice or healthcare organisations.
