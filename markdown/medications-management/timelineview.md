**Patient Safety Process**
The development lifecycle for this design guide includes an integrated patient / clinical safety risk assessment and management process.
Known patient safety incidents relevant to this design guidance area have been researched and reviewed as part of ongoing development. The resulting guidance points aim to support mitigation of these known patient safety risks. In addition, the developers of this design guide have undertaken a patient safety risk assessment to identify new risks that could potentially be introduced by the guidance points in this document. Any potential risks identified have been assessed and managed to support the ongoing clinical safety case for this design guide.
The Hazard Log records all the risks that have been identified during development and describes mitigatory actions that, in some cases, will need to be taken by users of this design guide. The Hazard Log is a live document that is updated as the design guide is developed and maintained. Until this design guide has received full Clinical Authority to Release (CATR) from the NHS Connecting for Health (CFH) Clinical Safety Group (CSG) – based on an approved Clinical Safety Case – there may be outstanding patient safety risks yet to be identified and mitigated.
Additionally, users implementing applications that follow this design guide’s guidelines (for example, healthcare system suppliers) are expected to undertake further clinical safety risk assessments of their specific systems within their specific context of use.
Refer to [NHS Common User Interface for further information on the patient safety process and for](http://www.cui.nhs.uk/Pages/NHSCommonUserInterface.aspx) the safety status and any relevant accompanying safety documentation for this design guide.
### 1 INTRODUCTION

This document provides guidance for the design of Timeline Views. It describes the area of focus, lists mandatory and recommended guidance points with usage examples and explains the rationale behind the guidance.

Patients’ medical records contain vast quantities of information which play a pivotal role in clinical decision making. This decision making relies critically upon swiftly gleaning an accurate and complete picture from a catalogue of previous and planned events while identifying cause-effect relationships and trends. In addition, being able to visualise planned activities in the context of past events provides the clinician with an ‘integrated vision’ of what has happened, what is about to happen, and what has just failed to happen. Timeline Views of patient clinical data provide this visualisation.

Timelines provide an easy mechanism to view and compare both items with duration, and single events, against time. There are a few current clinical systems which employ timelines of some description to convey information, sometimes to the patient, other times to the clinician or multi-disciplinary team.

There are not, however, guidelines which Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) can follow to help mitigate patient safety risks which may be encountered when showing clinical data in a Timeline View. This guidance document provides guidelines relating to the use of timelines to convey duration and event data in clinical systems developed by ISVs.

To indicate their relative importance, each guideline in this document is ranked by **Conformance** and by **Evidence Rating** . Table 1 defines those terms:

Conformance Indicates the extent to which you should follow the guideline when defining your UI implementation. There are two levels:

 **Mandatory**         - An implementation should follow the guideline

 **Recommended**         - An implementation is advised to follow the guideline

Evidence Rating Summarises the strength of the research defining the guideline and the extent to which it mitigates patient safety hazards. There are three ratings (with example factors used to determine the appropriate rating):

 **Low:**

 Does not mitigate specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings unclear and with few participants

 Unreferenced usability principles indicate the design is not significantly better than alternatives

 **Medium:**

 Mitigates specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings clear but with few participants

 References authoritative guidance (for example, from National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA), Institute for

Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) or World Health Organization (WHO)) that is potentially soon to be superseded

 Referenced usability principles indicate the design is significantly better than alternatives

 **High:**

 Mitigates specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings clear and with a significant number of participants

 References recent authoritative guidance (for example, from NPSA, ISMP or WHO)

 Referenced usability principles indicate the design is significantly better than alternatives

**Note**

Refer to section 9.2 for definitions of the specific terminology used in this document.

#### 1.1 Customer Need

The visualisation of clinical data against time is commonplace in clinical systems, but tends to be limited to quantitative information such as physiological observations data. However, the ability to visualise clinical event and duration information (in isolation or in combination with quantitative information such as ‘observations’ data) gives clinicians more context as to the patient’s condition and may assist them in identifying patterns in the data available for a patient.

Pattern detection is a universal human capacity which people tend to do very efficiently and often subconsciously. However, the detection and meaning of a data pattern can be heavily influenced by the way in which the data is presented, and misinterpretation may occur if the data is not presented in a way that clinicians can easily understand.

**Note**

When clinical data is visualised in a Timeline View, there is the possibility that clinicians may incorrectly interpret coincidental occurrences in time of clinical event and duration information as being evidence of a cause-effect relationship.

However, wrongly assuming a cause-effect relationship is not unique to Timeline Views, and clinicians have a professional responsibility to fully validate such assumptions before acting on them.

Research undertaken by the NHS in _Timelines in Health care_ **{R1}** identified the following areas, amongst others, where the visualisation of clinical events and durations for a patient could be beneficial for patient care and improve patient safety:

- Medications History

The visualisation of prescribed medications and data relating to the administration of those medications

- Medical History (the ‘past’ visualisation of the patient)

Being able to view at varying levels of detail the past medical history recorded for the patient, to enable the clinician to easily assimilate it

- Transfer of Care (the ‘about now’ visualisation of the patient)

In addition to transfer of care within hospital teams, transfer of care between secondary care and primary care, as well as between different hospitals, could benefit from the visualisation of patient data on a timeline.

- Secondary uses (for example, Clinical Audit)

The electronic format of medical records and coding in general already facilitates clinical audit. However, timelines may enable audit to be taken a step further and allow causal relationships to be identified. This guidance draws upon User Interface (UI) current best practice and upon research into the use of timelines in clinical settings.

This guidance is for use by Independent Software Vendors to ensure that good design principles support clinicians’ interpretation of duration and event information, reveal critical patterns and assist users in accessing more detailed information relating to the data being viewed.

##### 1.2.2 Out of Scope

This section defines areas that are not covered in this guidance. Although there may be specific risks associated with these areas that are not addressed in this guidance, it is likely that the principles in this guidance will extend to Timeline Views in many of the areas listed in Table 3.

Table 3 lists the subject areas that are not covered in this guidance:

Grouping timeline entries How to show different types of timeline data on the same canvas

Designing for multiple time axes This guidance is applicable to where time is displayed on the x-axis only

Collapse/expand control The appearance and interaction behaviour of any user control that collapses and expands (that is, hides and reveals) timeline visualised data

Sorting, filtering and grouping How to sort, filter and group timeline entries(for example, by title, time of occurrence or by some other data taxonomy attribute)

Linkage of control variables How to link controls on the form (for example, linking the level of detail shown for element attributes with the time window selection control so that for large time windows, minimal attributes are displayed)

Adding, removing or moving other data series

Accessing more info by navigating to or revealing more data

How to manage which data series are displayed as timelines, including the method of selecting from a list of available data series

How to access further information related to a selected item by navigating to another view or revealing the information in parallel with the timeline (for example, within a ‘pop-up’ dialogue)

Defaults for controls The defaults for controls (such as level of detail and section collapse/expand)

Representing absence of data How to indicate when information for a data series or type is not available to the system either temporarily (for example, due to a hardware failure) or for more fundamental reasons (such as lack of compatibility between systems)

Representing uncertainty How to graphically represent such notions of uncertainty as ‘event occurred sometime between January and March 2008’, ‘patient self-administered during Tuesday evening’, and ‘condition is likely to clear up within next 2 months’.

When to use a timeline representation When (and when not) to use a timeline representation as opposed to other representations of the same data.

Table 3: Subject Areas Not Covered by This Guidance

**Note**

Listing an item as out of scope does not classify it as unimportant. Project time and resource constraints inevitably restrict what can be in scope for a particular release. It is possible that items out of scope for this release may be considered for a future release.

#### 1.3 Assumptions

**A1** The quality (that is, provenance, accuracy, and completeness) of the data displayed in the Timeline View is of an acceptable level. Data quality will be particularly important in scenarios where there are multiple data sources (for example, from primary and secondary care settings) as the quality of the data may vary between sources.

Although the quality of data is not in scope for this guidance, the following risks were recorded during user research (see APPENDIX B):

 Coding of data is suboptimal; for example, coding is not good quality, or at the ‘wrong’ level for displaying on timeline

(where coding is at symptomatic level rather than at underlying etiology), or different codes are used to represent the same concept

 System cannot display all the data, or cannot be certain that all data is there

 User infers from the absence of unavailable data that no event(s) occurred

 Data is known to be missing but a ‘best estimate’ is not displayed

 If timelines are not implemented based upon encoded data (which aids aggregation of results) and are not in a record

which uses an individual coded statement approach, then Timeline Views may misrepresent the data stored in the system, and therefore clinicians may gain a mistaken or (unnecessarily) incomplete understanding of the patient

HSCIC Controlled Document

**A2** The system performance is adequate to display the quantity of data without significant delays (for example when scrolling through large quantities of data).

Although system performance is out of scope for this guidance, approaches that may improve performance recorded during research are:

 Cache data directly adjacent to the currently viewed time period (a technique used by popular Internet mapping sites to

enable seamless scrolling to adjacent areas)

 When navigation beyond the adjacent time periods is being performed, only update the viewing area once the user has

completed the action

**A3** The minimum screen resolution used by the clinician is 1024 x 768 pixels, although a higher resolution may be employed.

**A4** Medications viewed on a timeline will be shown using the intended start and end dates of the course of medication.

**A5** The Timeline View is not the only view of patient medical data in the Clinical System. All the data shown on the Timeline View is accessible through other views, including the view that represents the data as entered into the system.

**A6** Timelines are implemented based upon encoded data which aids aggregation of results, and a record which uses an individual coded statement approach.

**A7** Source data for the timeline supports duration, explicitly or by inference

### 2 TIMELINE GUIDANCE OVERVIEW

This guidance document provides high-level guidance for the implementation of a Timeline View within an ISV application. It aims to create a framework that will allow a variety of clinical data to be displayed in a timeline format. This can be any clinical data where temporal aspects are of interest (that is, the start and end times, duration and timing compared to other events).

This guidance does not seek to describe safe default settings for particular data-types in particular clinical contexts (for example, the safe default settings for displaying inpatient medications in a Timeline View). Guidance that does describe these kinds of safe defaults can be found in _Medications Management – Medications List – User Interface Design Guidance_ **{R8}** and _Medications Management – Drug Administration – User Interface Design Guidance_ **{R6}** .

The usage examples throughout this guidance display medications data. The settings the usage examples show (such as the level of detail per medication) should not be taken as safe for display in every clinical context where that medication is used.

**Note**

Significant patient safety risks were identified which can only be mitigated when taking into account the specific context of use. System implementers should conduct a detailed patient safety risk assessment to ensure the safe use of the timeline in their particular context.

Refer to sections 5.2.1, 6.2.3 and 7.2.1 for further details.

For more information on the safe display of medications please see:

- _Medications Management – Drug Administration – User Interface Design Guidance_ **{R6}**

- _Medications Management – Medication Line – User Interface Design Guidance_ **{R7}**

- _Medications Management – Medications List – User Interface Design Guidance_ **{R8}**

- _Medications Management – Search and Prescribe – User Interface Design_

_Guidance_ **{R15}**

Figure 1 shows how a Timeline View might look when displaying patient medications in an inpatient context. The default settings, such as how much detail is displayed per medication and whether administration status is shown, are notional and not part of this guidance.

The guidelines illustrated by the usage examples can be applied to other data-types in other clinical contexts. Similarly, any medication-specific guidance points could be abstracted to a higher level to also apply to other data-types.

**Important**

The visual representations used within this document to display the guidance are illustrative only. They are simplified in order to support understanding of the guidance points. Stylistic choices, such as colours, fonts or icons are not part of the guidance and unless otherwise specified are not mandatory requirements for compliance with the guidance in this document.

#### 2.2 Summary of Guidance

Table 6 summarises the content of this document by outlining each area of guidance (along with a cross-reference to the relevant section) and providing a visual example to illustrate how it might be implemented.

**Note**

Design illustrations are best viewed on a screen in colour.

Section 3 provides guidance on the overall layout of the Timeline View, including the positioning of the patient banner, options to navigate to other views, and the main timeline navigation controls.

HSCIC Controlled Document

Section 4 includes guidance on the appearance of the timeline viewing area, including background colours and row delineation, and time axis markers. The indication of past, present, and future time periods is also detailed.

Section 5 provides guidance for timeline entries (including entries with no duration, known duration, and open duration), timeline entry labels, and row identifier cells.

Section 5 also provides guidance on the display of graphs in conjunction with timeline entries.

Some quantitative data is better represented as a graph (for example, observations such as temperature, blood pressure, and so on.) These can be viewed in conjunction with a timeline representation of other data to provide comprehensive patient data visualisations.

HSCIC Controlled Document

Section 6 includes guidance on using timeline sections to group entries, and covers the display of section title bars, indication of any timeline entries within the chosen period that are out of view, and controlling the level of detail displayed in each section.

When the level of detail displayed in each timeline section can be controlled by the user, they can make best use of the available viewing space for their particular task.

For example, clinicians may wish to compare a medication’s dose changes (requiring a high level of detail for the ‘medications’ section) with the patient’s health issues (viewable at a lower level of detail for the ‘problems’ section).

Section 7 provides guidance on the positioning and appearance of sets of events related to timeline entries (for example, Pharmacist Review events), including multiple sets.

This section also covers the display of drug administrations as a related set of events.

#### 5.2 Guidelines

##### 5.2.1 Timeline Entries: Generic Considerations

Timeline entries are visualisations of medical record entries plotted against time. They can represent data at a point in time or over a duration.

HSCIC Controlled Document

##### 5.2.2 Timeline Entries with No Significant Duration

Some timeline entries occur at a point in time and have no duration. Examples of timeline entries with no duration are:

- ‘Once only’ prescriptions (other than once only infusions) that have no significant duration

(for example, tablets)

- General notes recording (for example, ‘past history of appendicectomy’)

##### 5.2.3 Timeline Entries with Known Duration

Many record entries have a period of validity determined by start and end times. Displaying entries with a known duration is one of the strengths of the timeline approach to data visualisation.

Examples are:

- Drug prescriptions that are for a defined period; for example, a prescription for an infusion

over 12 hours, or a seven day course of tablets

- Patient conditions that have been noted and then recorded as resolved; for example,

‘infected foot’

**Hazard Risk Analysis Summary:**

**Potential Hazards:** **Mitigations** :

 MTI073 dashed line misinterpreted as something else, such as on / off

 MTI079 Only ‘discrete’ items are displayed – no items with duration. Users forget that some events may imply a persistent condition (such as a diagnosis of asthma) and therefore do not factor in things like co-occurrence

 MTI153 If you ‘mouse over’ a shared prescription start/end blob (that is, shares two durations) - which duration is highlighted?

 MTI176 If two duration items one the same line have been stopped and started in quick succession (e.g. a medication dose is changed by stopping one and starting another) then it is quite likely that the two 'blobs' will occlude and so turn the 'crowding' UI on (which might make it harder to notice that items are separate?)

 MTI072 User mistakenly thinks that past events HAVE occurred, or that future events WILL occur

 MTI073 What if the dashed line (representing future items) is misinterpreted as something else, such as on / off?

 MTI162 The clinician mistakenly assumes that the solid and dotted line on prescriptions refers to administration status

 MTI163 The clinician is confused as to why the prescription line (a plan) changes to a dotted in the future as the PLAN to give it doesn't change, and that it might (incorrectly) be seen as a status change (such as an administration status change)

 TLN-0300 (Display duration as a horizontal unbroken line with

a thickness and colour that clearly distinguishes it from the background., with no fill colour )

 TLN-0300 (Display duration as a horizontal unbroken line with

a thickness and colour that clearly distinguishes it from the background with no fill colour). Risk is mitigated by displaying any items that have a duration

 TLN-0350 (Use a start time symbol with a left hand edge that

clearly aligns with the time axis) and TLN-0350 (Use an end time symbol with a right hand edge that clearly aligns with the time axis)

 TLN-0330, TLN-0350, TLN-0360 (Start and end items do not

occlude each other)

 TLN-0370 (Do not vary the style of timeline entries and labels

between past and future time periods)

 TLN-0370 (Do not vary the style of timeline entries and labels

between past and future time periods)

 TLN-0370(Do not vary the style of timeline entries and labels

between past and future time periods)

 TLN-0370 (Do not vary the style of timeline entries and labels

between past and future time periods)

##### 5.2.4 Timeline Entries with Open Duration

Sometimes the end time of a timeline entry is unknown, indeterminate or infinite.

Examples are:

- Current medical conditions which may (or may not) be resolved at some undetermined

time in the future

- Drugs prescribed on an ‘ongoing basis

- Amputations or congenital conditions which the patient will have for the duration of their

life

**Note**

These examples, with the exception of amputations and congenital conditions, may be updated to timeline entries with known duration if end times are later provided. Therefore, there is a need to represent timeline entries with an open duration.

##### 5.2.6 Row Identifier Cells

Additional to timeline labels, row identifier cells provide a means for the user to identify what is displayed in a row. This is particularly useful when, for the viewed time period, a row does not contain any timeline entries. Row identifier cells also provide the user a means for quickly assimilating the information that is being displayed. Figure 6 illustrates row identifier cells:

##### 5.2.7 Displaying Crowded Timeline Entries and Labels

When multiple timeline entries are displayed on a shared row and the user chooses a greater time period, the entries will be displayed closer together. As the chosen time period is increased, it is highly likely that the entries will become crowded.

### 6 GUIDANCE DETAILS FOR NAVIGATING TIMELINE ENTRIES WITHIN A CHOSEN TIME PERIOD

#### 6.1 Introduction

This part of the document includes guidance on using timeline sections to group entries, and covers the display of section title bars, indication of any timeline entries within the chosen period that are out of view, and controlling the level of detail displayed in each section. Figure 7 illustrates those features:

Figure 7: Timeline View Features Covered in this Section

#### 6.2 Guidelines

##### 6.2.1 Timeline Sections

Timeline sections provide a means of partitioning different information into related sets, giving users better control over what parts of the overall timeline canvas they can see at one time within the limitations of the display size.

|---|---|

(TLN-0850, TLN-0860, TLN-0870)|
||**Rationale**|
||Given the large amount of data that will be available and the relatively small screen spaces of normal desktop monitors, it will be<br>common to have more data to display vertically than space allows. Previous CUI work (_Medications Management – Medications List –_<br>_User Interface Design Guidance_**{R8})** concluded that in certain circumstances (such as for a list of medications), a scroll bar is not<br>sufficient indication that data is out of view.<br>The indicators provide a supplementary indication that data is out of view, positioned at the opposite side of the screen to the scroll<br>bar, near to a user’s vertical scan line down the row identifier column.<br>The indicator differs from the look-ahead examples in_Medications Management – Medications List – User Interface Design_<br>_Guidance_ **{R8}** because:<br> Summarising entries that are out of view in a horizontal line (such as a list of drug names) is likely to be impractical for many data<br>sets in a Timeline View as they will potentially have hundreds of line items. These items also may not be able to be summarised<br>safely <br> The medications look-ahead indicator only operates on one list in a view, so it only takes up a maximum of two lines of vertical<br>space (at the top and the bottom of the scrollbar). The Timeline View may have many sections, most of which may have data<br>vertically out of view. If each also had two extra lines of ‘data out of view’ indicators this would take up a lot of vertical space and<br>further interrupt the vertical scanning of the view. As described in TLN-0840 the timeline indicator already has a means to interrupt<br>a user’s vertical scan and alert them to the presence of out of view items <br>Displaying a count of entries out of view is consistent with_Medications Management – Medications List – User Interface Design_<br>_Guidance_ **{R8}**. <br>An indication that extends horizontally across the view is more likely to be noticed when user’s are scanning down the middle section<br>of the view, and as such is also consistent with the risk mitigation behind the_Medications Management – Medications List – User_<br>_Interface Design Guidance_ **{R8}.** <br>**Hazard Risk Analysis Summary:** <br>**Potential Hazards:** <br>**Mitigations:** <br> <br>MTI068 User is not aware that data is contained<br>within a category (as it is scrolled out of view) <br> TLN-0850, TLN-0860, TLN-0870 (Indicating timeline entries within<br>the chosen time period that are out of view)|

##### 6.2.3 Timeline Section Levels of Detail

Clinicians can make best use of the viewing space available for their task when they can control the level of detail displayed in each timeline section.

For example, clinicians may wish to compare a medication’s dose changes (requiring a high level of detail for the ‘medications’ section) with the patient’s health issues (viewable at a lower level of detail for the ‘problems’ section).

### 7 GUIDANCE DETAILS FOR DISPLAYING SETS OF RELATED EVENTS

#### 7.1 Introduction

This section provides guidance on the positioning and appearance of sets of events related to timeline entries, including multiple sets.

Often, information related to timeline entries is usefully represented as a set of related events. Figure 8 illustrates how, for medications, three sets of events could be visualised:

- Administrations

- Pharmacy reviews

- International Normalised Ratio (INR) results

By having access to these additional layers of information, the clinician can review the sequence of events and explore potential cause-effect relationships at a more granular level.

Figure 8: Visualisation of Three Sets of Events for Medications

This section also covers the display of drug administration status as a related attribute set, as shown in Figure 9:

### 8 GUIDANCE DETAILS FOR NAVIGATING TIME

#### 8.1 Introduction

This section contains guidance for adjusting the time range displayed in the timeline viewing area and navigating across the total time range

Whereas previous sections of this document have provided guidance on how to best display and navigate timeline entries for a selected time period, this section considers navigation across the total time period that is available for display.

This guidance covers the selection of the viewed time range, navigation to time periods adjacent to the current time period and larger scale navigation to time points throughout the total time period. Figure 10 illustrates those features:

The Authority The organisation implementing the NHS National Programme for IT (currently NHS Connecting for Health).

Conformance In the guidance tables, indicates the extent to which you should follow the guideline when defining your UI implementation. There are two levels:

 **Mandatory**          - An implementation should follow the guideline

 **Recommended**          - An implementation is advised to follow the guideline

Current best practice Current best practice is used rather than best practice, as over time best practice guidance may change or be

revised due to changes to products, changes in technology, or simply the additional field deployment experience that comes over time.

Evidence Rating In the guidance tables, summarises the strength of the research defining the guideline and the extent to which it mitigates patient safety hazards. There are three ratings (with example factors used to determine the appropriate rating):

 **Low:**

 Does not mitigate specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings unclear and with few participants

 Unreferenced usability principles indicate the design is not significantly better than alternatives

 **Medium:**

 Mitigates specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings clear but with few participants

 References old authoritative guidance (for example, from National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA),

Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) or World Health Organization (WHO)) that is potentially soon to be superseded

 Referenced usability principles indicate the design is significantly better than alternatives

 **High:**

 Mitigates specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings clear and with a significant number of participants

 References recent authoritative guidance (for example, from NPSA, ISMP or WHO)

 Referenced usability principles indicate the design is significantly better than alternatives

### APPENDIX B STUDY ID 33: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

#### B.1 Abstract

The UK National Health Service (NHS) Common User Interface (CUI) programme is a partnership between Microsoft [®] and NHS Connecting for Health (NHS CFH), which is part the NHS National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT).

As part of CUI, the Clinical Applications and Patient Safety (CAPS) Project has the goal of ensuring that software applications used by the NHS enhance patient safety. To achieve this, CAPS provides software developers with user interface design guidelines derived through a user-centric development process that includes explicit patient-safety evaluations.

This summary describes key findings from user research carried out in April 2009 by the CUI CAPS team on the display of clinical data in a Timeline View. These findings are a subset from a larger internal report prepared for the CUI CAPS Timeline team.

**Purpose:**

To gain clinical feedback on design concepts for Timeline Views of clinical data (primarily medications) in electronic systems.

**Method:**

Interviews: structured interviews with 13 Health Care Professionals (HCPs) eliciting HCP preferences and qualitative feedback on design alternatives.

**Key Results:**

Based on clinician preference and rationale:

- The distinction between prescription item and medication administration items should be

clearer

- Options for alternative marking of future duration items should be considered, including

having the same representation for past and future

- The canvas background should mark a distinction between past and future. However, this

should be subtle and take into account readability of all the elements on the canvas (including gridlines)

- The ability to view labels both inline and in a left column should be considered

- The ability for the clinician to vary the level of detail and line identity should be retained (for

example, the ability to aggregate prescriptions to the 'drug name' level)

- Further methods for reorganising large datasets and indicating data out of view should be

explored

#### B.2 Research Objectives

To gather HCP design preferences and qualitative feedback on, and to identify possible patient safety hazards with, CUI Timeline View designs.

#### B.3 Research Design

Interviews were structured, lasted one hour and carried out in person or by telephone. Participants were taken through wireframe design alternatives for each area of investigation and a Microsoft [®] Office Excel [®] mockup, and then asked for preference based on patient safety criteria. Other qualitative feedback was elicited covering:

- Rationale for preference

- Design fit with current and best practice

- Design understandability

- Any potential hazards resulting from the designs.

Detailed notes from the interviews were qualitatively analysed using thematic coding.

#### B.4 Results

##### B.4.1 Participant Description

13 participants were interviewed separately. Each had either volunteered through the NHS CFH Event Management System (EMS) signup or had been recruited by an HCP who had volunteered. Four out of 13 participants had previously taken part in CUI clinical engagement for other work areas. Table 12 shows a summary of the participants’ profiles:

HSCIC Controlled Document

All participants were clinical staff who had experience of viewing clinical data such as medications in an inpatient setting. Participants were scoped to secondary care (and mainly inpatient care) as per the scope and example datasets for the CUI timelines work.

The 10 secondary care participants were from a number of different trusts different trusts, with diverse geographical locations.

All participants had used some kind of electronic patient record, though only one (participant 397) had used electronic timeline displays of clinical data before. The majority had medium computer experience, where high experience includes items such as being familiar with spreadsheet calculation functions and having an understanding of databases.

##### B.4.2 Design Areas

Bullet text _in italics_ represents researcher recommendations or comments in order to distinguish them from user feedback.

_**Duration Items – General**_

- Participants made various errors in misinterpreting the ‘prescription’ duration items as

medication administration status indicators:

 _Therefore, continue to allow the display of medication administration items (to clarify the_ _ambiguity)_

 _Consider how the ambiguity could be further clarified (for example, with a default setting_ _for inpatient contexts that showed medication administration whenever showing_ _medication data)_

- One participant assumed an item start date was when the item appeared on screen on the

left:

 _Ensure it is clear where items start or stop_

_**Duration Items – Future Items**_

- Examples of different styling for ‘future’ items raised a variety of feedback, with concerns

raised about items potentially being mistaken as ‘progress bars’, or wide-dotted items as separate events, and more complex styling resulting in an overly ‘busy’ view

- Several participants suggested that planned items (such as prescriptions) should not look

different in the past and future as the _plan_ to have them was certain, even though the future is by nature uncertain:

 _Therefore, consider the potential risks of misinterpretation. If the line does change it_ _might be more likely to be misinterpreted as a status indicator_

 _Consider the balance between redundant cues and overall visual weight (that is, if_ _future is already conveyed by a canvas background change, is line styling change_ _necessary?)_

_**Discrete Items**_

- Some icons are potentially confusable with others:

 _Reduce sharing of visual attributes between icon types_

- Neither option presented for dealing with crowded icons was deemed to be that clear:

 _Continue to explore, incorporating ‘squashing tolerance’ work from the_ Displaying Graphs and Tables – User Interface Design Guidance **{R5}** _document_

HSCIC Controlled Document

- _Though the indication of overdue items was commented on favourably, further consistency_

_with the_ Medications Management – Drug Administration – User Interface Design Guidance **{R6}** _should be explored_

_**Canvas Background**_

- 11 of 12 participants supported having a background shade distinction between past and

future. This was both to draw attention to ‘now’ and to provide extra cues as to whether an item was past or future:

 _Continue to provide a background shade distinction_

- Opinion was divided on what shades to use for current and past, mainly based on

metaphorical reasoning “the future is a blank slate”:

 _Consider readability implications for using shaded and/or coloured background (for_ _example, darker backgrounds may make it harder to read items and hide gridlines)_

_**Labels**_

- Most participants preferred having labels both ‘inline’ (to improve the association between

the lines and labels) AND in a left column (to allow for ease of scanning the list and familiarity with current representations of medication lists):

 _Strongly consider ability to display both ‘inline’ AND ‘left’ labels_

_**Continuous Administration**_

- Participants made various errors due to the word ‘continuous’:

 _ePrescribing team to consider naming issue_

_**Thumbnail**_

- Two participants initially assumed the thumbnail indicated medications started 20 years

before they had:

 _Consider how to mitigate this error_

 _The thumbnail also continually takes up space, which might be better used for the main_ _data display_

_**Active and Inactive**_

- Participants mistakenly interpreted the red and green colours representing active and

inactive:

 _Do not use red and green to indicate status change_

- Several participants mistakenly assumed only a few medications were current and/or

active:

 _Consider how to indicate that other medications are out of view_

 _Consider visual distinction of active and inactive items_

HSCIC Controlled Document

_**Level of Detail and Line Identity**_

- All participants felt that Level of Detail (LoD) 2 (aggregating lines to the drug name level

with full prescription details hidden) was a useful addition to LoD 4 (seeing each prescription as a separate line with full drug details):

 _Continue to allow the line identity and level of detail to be varied by the clinician_

- Some participants were concerned at being able to see medications without administration

information as this is not current practice in inpatient secondary care:

 _Consult with the CUI medications team_

_**Item Changes**_

- Though 5 of 10 participants did not initially understand the meaning of the markers to

indicate item change (in this case, a change in prescription), once understood all supported the need to clearly mark this:

 _Continue to display markers of item change when line identity is shrunk_

_**Representing ‘Health Issues’**_

- Many issues were raised about the representation of patient problems/health issues,

especially regarding line identity, ‘?’ problems and the differences between symptoms and diagnoses:

 _Consider these issues in future clinical noting work_

- Being able to vary line identity helped participants understand the nature of the problems:

 _Consider these issues in future clinical noting work_

_**Navigation and Large Datasets**_

- Navigating the large (and arguably more realistic) dataset was very problematic for the few

participants it was shown to:

 _Consider guidance on minimising the amount of vertical space each row takes up to get_ _more in a single screen_

 _Continue to explore other methods for reorganising data (for example, filtering, sorting_ _and grouping) and for indicating data out of view_
