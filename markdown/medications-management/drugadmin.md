**Patient Safety Process**
The development lifecycle for this design guide includes an integrated patient / clinical safety risk assessment and management process.
Known patient safety incidents relevant to this design guidance area have been researched and reviewed as part of ongoing development. The resulting guidance points aim to support mitigation of these known patient safety risks. In addition, the developers of this design guide have undertaken a patient safety risk assessment to identify new risks that could potentially be introduced by the guidance points in this document. Any potential risks identified have been assessed and managed to support the ongoing clinical safety case for this design guide.
The Hazard Log records all the risks that have been identified during development and describes mitigatory actions that, in some cases, will need to be taken by users of this design guide. The Hazard Log is a live document that is updated as the design guide is developed and maintained. Until this design guide has received full Clinical Authority to Release (CATR) from the NHS Connecting for Health (CFH) Clinical Safety Group (CSG) – based on an approved Clinical Safety Case – there may be outstanding patient safety risks yet to be identified and mitigated.
Additionally, users implementing applications that follow this design guide’s guidelines (for example, healthcare system suppliers) are expected to undertake further clinical safety risk assessments of their specific systems within their specific context of use.
[Refer to www.cui.nhs.uk](http://www.cui.nhs.uk/) for further information on the patient safety process and for the safety status and any relevant accompanying safety documentation for this design guide.
#### 1 INTRODUCTION

This document provides design guidance for Drug Administration. It describes the area of focus, provides guidance and recommendations and explains the rationale behind the guidance and recommendations.

To indicate their relative importance, each guideline in this document is ranked by **Conformance** and by **Evidence Rating** . Table 1 defines those terms:

Conformance Indicates the extent to which you should follow the guideline when defining your UI implementation. There are two levels:

 **Mandatory**         - An implementation should follow the guideline

 **Recommended**         - An implementation is advised to follow the guideline

Evidence Rating Summarises the strength of the research defining the guideline and the extent to which it mitigates patient safety hazards. There are three ratings (with example factors used to determine the appropriate rating):

 **Low:**

 Does not mitigate specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings unclear and with few participants

 Unreferenced usability principles indicate the design is not significantly better than alternatives

 **Medium:**

 Mitigates specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings clear but with few participants

 References old authoritative guidance (for example, from National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA),

Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) or World Health Organization (WHO)) that is potentially soon to be superseded

 Referenced usability principles indicate the design is significantly better than alternatives

 **High:**

 Mitigates specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings clear and with a significant number of participants

 References recent authoritative guidance (for example, from NPSA, ISMP or WHO)

 Referenced usability principles indicate the design is significantly better than alternatives

Table 1: Conformance and Evidence Rating Definitions

**Note**

It is also important to understand the meaning of the term ‘current’ as used in this document. Current medications refer to those that have been prescribed to a patient and have not yet been discontinued or completed. A medication can also be termed current with reference to a time in the past when the medication was current for the patient.

Refer to section 4.2 for definitions of the specific terminology used in this document.

This document is intended for use by anyone whose role involves screen design and the implementation or assessment of NHS clinical applications. This document can therefore be used as guidance for the specification of display and interaction models for drug administration.

##### 1.1 Customer Need

The administration (or giving) of drugs to patients has long been recognised as a safety-critical area [1]. It is both a complex activity in itself and the last possibility for care professionals to pick up errors made earlier in the overall process of drug management. A successful display solution must therefore perform a dual function:

- Provide sufficient information to review the intended schedule and previous history of

administration

- Support the tasks at hand safely (for example, record administration events).

**Paper Charts**  - Over 20 paper based charts from a variety of locations and specialities have been assessed. The overall format of paper drug charts are broadly consistent, however there are significant differences in design, with no clearly-favoured standard for layout and organisation. Some of these design differences may well already impact patient safety as care professionals move between hospitals and have to get used to new information groupings while working in stressful environments. A key feature of paper charts is their size: they typically run to a number of sides of A4 and contain large amounts of information that needs to be viewed simultaneously for maximum comprehension.

Consistent design principles identified through these reviews are reflected in the design outlined in this document (for example, locating the information about the drug on the left hand side of the screen and the administration events on the right hand side). Much of this document will refer to this ‘Typical Generic Paper’ (TGP) drug chart, an example of which is shown in Figure 1:

Figure 1: Example of a TGP Drug Chart Format for a Regular Drug

![](drugadmin_assets/drugadmin.pdf-6-1.png)
HSCIC Controlled Document

Points to note about this TGP drug chart style are:

- The drug details are located in a panel located on the left hand side

- Dates of administration are located along a top title bar

- Administration times are not fixed

- Administration times are located between the left hand details and the main administration

event area

- Six administration timeslots are permanently available

- Drugs are often split into the following categories:

 Once Only

 Regular

 As Required (also known as ‘PRN’, referencing the Latin _Pro Re Nata_ )

 Infusions

- There are often additional categories (such as ‘Oral Anticoagulants’ and ‘Insulin’) that have

dedicated areas on the chart or are recorded on subsidiary charts

**Electronic systems**  - The display formats for medicines administration information within electronic systems are much less consistent than the formats of paper charts. These differences impact both the review and task completion functions referred to above and will become a safety concern as electronic systems become more widely available. The challenge for developers of electronic systems is particularly great in this area, as there are no universally-accepted, paperbased standards to refer to and computer screens are not capable of displaying the same density of information as a sheet of A4 paper (let alone a fold-out chart, which may cover up to three sheets). This ‘information density problem’ is one of the primary reasons why designers of electronic systems resort to ‘creative solutions’ and why display solutions inevitably diverge. The intention of this guidance is to use design principles that are common across paper drug charts so that there is a familiarity with aspects of the current paper drug charts, thus reducing the training required to move to these electronic systems.

**Note**

Also see the _ePrescribing System Evaluations_ document _[2]_.

##### 1.2 Scope

The guidance in this document is for the Drug Administration View. This view is envisaged as being part of a clinical system that includes a series of views, some of which present medications information for each patient. Guidance for the display of a patient's medications is defined in _Medications Management – Medications List – User Interface Design Guidance_ **{R3}**, and more detailed guidance for the layout and formatting of individual medications is defined in _Medications_ _Management – Medication Line – User Interface Design Guidance_ **{R4}** . Medications may also be displayed within another view, such as a Timeline View as defined in _Timeline View – User_ _Interface Design Guidance_ **{R5}** .

Figure 2 shows a simple outline of the structure and layout of elements within the Drug Administration View. This illustration is used throughout the document, with shaded sections highlighting the area to which the guidance in that section applies.

###### 1.2.1 In Scope

This guidance has been developed for, and is supported by research in, short-term acute managed care settings. The guidance is relevant to the presentation of, and interaction with, drug information for a single patient. This is specifically to support the detailed review of administration events and to record drug administrations.

Although this view has been developed for a particular setting, the design has been created so that it can be used in other settings. There are some areas where the detail required is more than the space available in the Chart Area. In this case, the user should be able to click in the relevant area to view more detail. The Drug Administration View remains a valid overview. The drugs referred to in the out of scope section (section 1.2.2) will either fit into the summary view or require an additional level of detail that the user can navigate to so are catered for by the generic design principles in this document.

The guidance in this document covers the following features:

- Recording a successful drug administration for a single patient

- Recording an unsuccessful drug administration for a single patient

- Reviewing details of an individual administration event (past administrations) for a single

patient

The following users are covered in this guidance:

- Doctor

- Nurse

- Pharmacist

The following care settings are covered in this guidance:

- Acute managed care (Inpatient)

The following types of drugs are covered in this guidance:

###### 1.2.3 Decision Support Statement

Some of the guidance points in this document might be interpreted as implying that the system offers a degree of decision support (for example, time lockouts on As Required medication). However, a full definition of decision support is out of scope for this document.

##### 1.3 Assumptions

A1 The Drug Administration View is one of a set of drugs views within a medications framework that assumes the presence of a drugs section within a patient record.

A2 This guidance assumes that the clinical application will have a complete record of drugs for each patient and that the application can access and combine information about current and previous drugs.

A3 This guidance assumes that the user can access any allergy information recorded about the patient.

#### 2 GUIDANCE OVERVIEW

The guidance in this document describes a view for displaying a single patient’s drug administration schedule and history and for the recording of individual drug administration events. This **Drug** **Administration View** supports the tasks of drug administration recording and drug administration review from a single view.

The structure of the full end-to-end process of drug administration has been considered when designing this guidance. However, only the items listed in section 1.2.1 are in scope for this document. Section 2.2 summarises the guidance points detailed in the rest of this document.

**Important**

The visual representations used within this document to display the guidance are illustrative only. They are simplified in order to support understanding of the guidance points. Stylistic choices, such as colours, fonts or icons are not part of the guidance and unless otherwise specified are not mandatory requirements for compliance with the guidance in this document.

Though it is not explicit guidance, the illustrations in this document and in _Medications List_ **{R3}** follow the secondary care convention of having each fixed dose prescription on a new line, rather than, for example, putting all prescriptions for the same medication on the same line. Variable dose prescriptions may follow different conventions

In several of the usage examples, notional icons are illustrated by placeholders. Figure 10 shows examples of such notional icons:

##### 2.1 Rationale Summary

The guidance in this document works towards reducing patient safety risks arising from the information used to administer drugs.

General Principles:

- The identification of specific drugs that are due for administration

- Supporting the safe recording of drug administrations

- Must be able to record what actually happened

- Aim not to introduce any additional risks from current paper practice

Usability Principles:

- Highlight the primary functions to support accurate recording of what happened for an

administration event

- Display safety critical elements to the clinician without requiring user action

- Promote the primary functions to support quick recording of an administration event

- Support access to secondary functions without introducing screen clutter

- Transfer key design principles from the paper drug charts studied to reduce the need for

training and increase familiarity when users move to electronic systems.

#### 3 DRUG ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINES

##### 3.1 Introduction

This section of the document presents the guidance for the Drug Administration View split by component or topic area.

##### 3.2 Principles

The following key principles inform this guidance:

- Provide a visually-rich chart of information relevant to, and prioritised for, the administration

of drugs

- Support the presentation of drugs with different characteristics (such as Significant

Duration, Once Only or As Required drugs) within one view

- Display sufficient information for an accurate interpretation of the administration schedule

(past, current and planned) and status of administration events within a relevant time interval

- Restrict the display of unnecessary information to reduce clutter and prioritise the

information most likely to require action

- Provide access, in context, to further details on demand

- Mitigate the potential for action to be taken without sufficient information by presenting

carefully selected information and explicit labels to clarify what information is displayed and the extent to which it is complete

- When dynamically presenting information (such as status information, error messages or

warnings), display the information in context and facilitate action where necessary by clearly providing associated controls

- Support efficient and accurate recording of administration events with enough flexibility for

differences in drugs and working practices

##### 3.3 Structure and Contents

This section of the guidance document looks at the general composition of the Drug Administration View. It describes the rules concerning the overall structure and contents required.

###### 3.3.1 Composition of the Drug Administration View

The guidance points in this section relate to the whole Chart Area used to display the medication lines in the Drug Administration View. Figure 11 highlights this area:

MEDa-0002

Though it is not explicit guidance, the illustrations in this document and in _Medications List_ **{R3}** follow the secondary care convention of having each fixed dose prescription on a new line, rather than, for example, putting all prescriptions for the same medication on the same line. Variable dose prescriptions may follow different conventions.

Medication ‘lines’ in the Drug Administration View are collections of text, lines and symbols. Medication lines need to be clearly demarcated from each other in order to prevent misreading between the lines. For example, misassociating the left hand drug details with another line’s administration events. Alternative means of demarcating the lines (such as alternate row shading or keylines) would not on their own be sufficient to distinguish the medication line.

MEDa-0003

Medication lines are separated by ‘white space’ to provide a clear but uncluttered division between the lines to reduce the risk of misreading.

###### 3.3.2 Inclusion Criteria

The guidance points in this section relate to when a medication line is included in the available list in the Drug Administration View. Figure 15 displays an example of this list:

Figure 15: Inclusion Criteria Area

**Note**

In this document, ‘current’ medications refer to those that have been prescribed to a patient and have not yet been discontinued or completed. A medication can also be termed current with reference to a time in the past when the medication was current for the patient.

##### 3.4 List Order

The guidance points in this section relate to the hierarchical list order for the drug lines in the Drug Administration View. Figure 19 displays an example of this list using just the labels:

Figure 19: List Order

This section includes guidance that defines the rules for determining the list order for drugs in the Drug Administration View. This guidance assumes that the system will have access to information about when the drugs are scheduled to be administered and what is considered to be a safe threshold of time tolerance for how early or late a drug can be given before it is not considered to have been given on time.

**Note**

Time tolerances will be down to local governance and are not defined in this document.

The terms defined in Table 6 are used in this section and later in the document to refer to states of scheduled administrations:

Page 26

Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre

![](drugadmin_assets/drugadmin.pdf-30-1.png)
HSCIC Controlled Document

Empty Future The event is scheduled but is not Due, Overdue or Next

Next Next event to be Given The event is the Next chronological event for that drug that is not Due or Overdue

Due Ready to be Given The event is within the tolerances for the drug administration schedule (example time tolerances could be one hour before and after the scheduled administration time)

Overdue Should have been Given by now

Begun Drug administration underway

Depends on context

If administered while Next, the administration might be categorised as Given Early

If administered while Due, the administration might be categorised as Given

If administered while Overdue, the administration might be categorised as Given Late.

Depends on context

If administered As Required, the administration might be categorised as Given

Unscheduled As Required

A drug that is administered according to patient need

The event is later than the time constraints of the drug administration schedule

A Significant Duration drug such as an infusion (see section 3.13), for which a start date and time have been recorded, is scheduled to still be running and has nothing recorded to indicate that it has stopped.

A drug that has not been given a regular schedule and therefore is only given on an ad-hoc basis based on clinical judgement and preset criteria. For more on As Required medication see section 3.9.1.

Table 6: Scheduled Administration Terms

In summary, the list-ordering rules place:

- Overdue drugs at the top of the list

- Drugs with scheduled administrations that are not yet Due lower in the list

- Drugs with only past administrations (and no further planned administrations) at the bottom

of the list

**Note**

The list order is based on the time of Next scheduled administration and not on any clinical decision support.

Given that reordering of drug lists is unfamiliar to the vast majority of current NHS staff, the feature was the subject of repeated clinician assessment. Three rounds of user feedback with small numbers of clinicians showed support for a dynamic ordering by ‘dueness’ as the most appropriate order for supporting the task of drug administration, as opposed to a fixed sort order (for example, by start date) ( **{R13, R14},** see APPENDIX A and APPENDIX B). Those responses were based on the assumption that users would be able to access a ‘fixed’ sort order (for example, by start date) if required. Staff who use the administration schedule and history for tasks other than drug administration (such as pharmacists) felt the ordering by dueness was less appropriate (see APPENDIX A) **.** Though positive about the concept of dynamic ordering, clinicians were generally concerned that it would require training to explain its use.

Another approach to bringing Due and Overdue medications to the clinician’s attention would have been to filter the list (or provide access to a filtered list) of only those medications which are Due or Overdue. However, this approach was felt to reduce the clinician’s awareness of the patient’s other medications. In addition, reordering can provide a more fine-grained distinction between medication priorities than pure filtering (for example, by ordering Overdue above Due and more Due above less Due).

Though not specified in guidance, use of reordering would allow additional rules to support local administration conventions. For example, some wards may have a convention to administer intravenous (IV) medications after non-IV medications if both are scheduled for the same drug round time. In this case, an additional setting (which has not been hazard assessed) might be that for medications Due at the same time, non-IV should be ordered above IV.

MEDa-0032

The list reordering should not be totally dynamic. It should only reorder when:

 It is manually refreshed

 The view is re-opened

 A medication is added or updated (by anyone)

This is so users retain control and can see feedback from the actions they perform that trigger a change in order. For example, when a clinician records a Due administration as Given, a totally dynamic reordering would immediately move the medication further down the list. The medication would seem to ‘disappear’ from view and another medication ‘appear’ in its place. This potential confusion is removed by not allowing automatic reordering while the list is open.

MEDa-0264

The label of ‘Begun’ is only recommended as it was only suggested late in the guidance development process and has not been evaluated or formally risk assessed. The challenges for this label are that it has to be unambiguous such that:

 It is associated only with Significant Duration drugs (‘Start’ is used as a label associated with all medications courses)

 It only conveys that the medication has been started and not that it is running to plan (the system does not know this at this point)

 It is not confused with the ‘To Start At’ indicator for Significant Duration medications

##### 3.5 Drug Administration View Controls

###### 3.5.1 Controls in the Drug Administration View

The guidance points in this section relate to the main controls for the Drug Administration View. Figure 22 highlights the area in which they are located:

Figure 22: Main Controls

Guidance for the controls for navigating between different views of drugs and for manipulating the Drug Administration View is defined in the _Medications List_ document **{R3}** . The guidance in this section is for the controls associated specifically with the Drug Administration View.

MEDa-0248

Filtering of the view introduces the risk that a clinician may miss a medication or administration event when looking at the chart and, as a result, he or she may potentially not perform or delay an administration. This guidance assumes that longer, scrollable lists are less likely to cause the clinician to overlook items. This principle is similar to that used in the _Medications List_ document **{R3}** .

User controlled filtering of the view is also not permitted as:

 The list is already filtered to those medications current within the four days in view

 It would be difficult to clearly communicate further filtering

 The view is already visually rich and further filtering controls and indications might overwhelm a user

###### 3.5.2 Grouping

The guidance points in this section relate to the Grouping Control for the Drug Administration View. Figure 25 highlights the area in which it is located:

Figure 25: Grouping Control

The Grouping Control is a standard control that is also used in the Medications List View and may be used in other drug views. Generic guidance for this control, including examples of grouping that may be applied, is defined in the _Medications List_ document **{R3}** .

MEDa-0218

As described in the section 3.4 rationale, the reordering of drug lists was the subject of repeated clinician assessment as it is unfamiliar to the vast majority of current NHS staff. User responses showed support for a dynamic ordering by ‘dueness’. However, those responses were based on the assumption that users would be able to access a ‘fixed’ order (for example, by start date) if required, as this was more familiar ( **{R13, R14},** see APPENDIX A and APPENDIX B). _Medications List_ **{R3}** defaults to a static sort order by start date and time.

MEDa-0219

Of the 20 or so paper drug charts from different trusts analysed, the majority had a core set of groups:

 Once Only

 As Required

 Regular

 Infusions

But, many had further subdivisions including variable medications, oral anticoagulants, syringe drivers, IV regulars and so on. That is, there is no current, universal convention for the exact groups to use but a fairly standard minimum set does exist. Furthermore, observations of chart usage showed that the ‘Infusions’ group was used differently by different clinicians.

###### 3.5.3 Status Bar

The guidance points in this section relate to the Status Bar control for the Drug Administration View. Figure 28 highlights the area in which it is located:

Figure 28: Status Bar Control

The Status Bar serves two main functions:

1. It highlights drugs with important states, such as those that have administrations that are

Overdue

2. It provides controls that allow drugs in the list to be reordered according to a predefined set

of rules that are designed to bring drugs that need attention to the top of the list

##### 3.6 Navigation

The guidance points in this section relate to the day navigation controls for the Drug Administration View. Figure 31 highlights the area in which they are located:

Figure 31: Day Navigation Controls

Navigation involves using the controls to move the Chart Area backwards or forwards one day or using the calendar control to move a specific date into view.

In this section, ‘navigation’ refers to navigating the chart by changing the time interval being displayed in the Chart Area so that administration events further in the past or future can be reviewed.

Navigation controls that step through the chart day-by-day are provided at either side of the column headings for the Chart Area and the calendar control is displayed within the column heading for the currently-selected day.

##### 3.7 The Look-Ahead Scroll Bar

The guidance points in this section relate to the Look-Ahead Scroll Bar (LASB) control for the Drug Administration View. Figure 36 highlights the area in which it is located:

Figure 36: Look-Ahead Scroll Bar Area

The LASB is a modification from a standard scroll bar control that is designed to enhance visibility of the presence of list items that are out of view. Generic guidance for the Look-Ahead Scroll Bar is defined in the _Medications List_ document **{R3}** . This section defines additional guidance specifically for enhancements to the Look-Ahead Scroll Bar when it is used in the Drug Administration View.

The guidance in this section relates specifically to the display of Overdue and Due drugs in the look-ahead notification areas.

##### 3.8 Left-Hand Panel

The Left-Hand Panel (LHP) is a static area that contains a text description of the drug represented on that line, as well as controls which indicate the presence of further information and allow this further information to be displayed. The following sections describe the contents of the Left-Hand Panel and guidance for accessing and displaying further information.

###### 3.8.1 LHP Structure and Contents

The guidance points in this section relate to the whole of the Left-Hand Panel and its associated contents for the medication lines in the Drug Administration View. Figure 44 highlights the area in which it is located:

HSCIC Controlled Document

NMC guidance on medications management **{R12}** requires that the registrant must make certain checks before administering a medicinal product:

 The prescription (or other direction to administer) is signed and dated by the authorised prescriber

 That they can contact the prescriber

It is arguable that a continually visible prescriber name is not necessary as medication cannot get onto the Drug Administration View unless it has been prescribed by an authorised prescriber. Additionally, accessing the prescriber’s name could perhaps be by a link or button rather than a continually visible name. However, it was felt that there is a strong expectation to see the prescriber name due to many years of experience with the paper charts, and that continual display of the prescriber name provides a reassuring familiarity.

MEDa-0044, MEDa-0045

Display of the start, end and/or review dates allows the clinician to see the duration of the course immediately. The clinician does not have to navigate by time through the view to find the dates and then calculate the duration manually. Displaying the dates helps support the NMC requirement for the registrant to check the start and end dates before administration. Display of the start date is common to many examples of existing paper charts (some also display the stop date).

MEDa-0222, MEDa-0223

User feedback (see APPENDIX B) concluded that it was important to clearly indicate both whether a medication was past and, if so, whether it was completed or discontinued.

###### 3.8.2 LHP Icons

The guidance points in this section relate to the icons presented in the Left-Hand Panel of the drug lines in the Drug Administration View. Figure 50 highlights the area in which these might be located:

Figure 50: LHP Information Icon Area

Icons are used in two different ways in the Information Panel:

1. As additions to text labels (label icons)

2. To signify the presence (or absence) of certain types of information (status icons)

The icons that are used to signify the presence of information (status icons) are also controls used to open the Information Panel in which that information is displayed.

Consistent placement of a notification near to the main drug details helps remind the clinician this information may need to be checked.

MEDa-0059

Icons for start date, end or review dates are used in the Chart Area. Using them as additional labels in the LHP helps provide familiarity with the icons and reinforces their meaning. The prescriber icon provides access to more details about the prescriber.

MEDa-0266, MEDa-0267, MEDa-0229

Widespread current practice is for pharmacists to mark verified prescriptions on the paper drug chart, often using notation such as a green tick. User feedback from nurses reported that seeing a medication has been verified provided extra confidence that the medication was correct, even though administration of most medications is allowed before pharmacy verification (see APPENDIX A) **.**

User feedback from a wider variety of clinicians highlighted that it would be beneficial to know at a glance if the prescription has been checked (see APPENDIX A and APPENDIX B) **.**

The guidance to mark verified medications (as opposed to marking unverified medications) follows this existing practice in order to increase the familiarity of the view. User feedback supports marking verified medications (see APPENDIX B) **.**

MEDa-0268

A ‘disabled’ pharmacist verification icon might be incorrectly interpreted as meaning ‘not verified’. In fact, it is intended to mean ‘the system does not know if the medication has been verified’. In a worst case scenario, a ‘disabled’ verification icon might be misinterpreted as meaning that the medication has been checked. This might arise because the use of three states (verified, not verified and disabled) reduces the clarity between the verified and not verified states.

Presenting no icon also reduces clutter in the view.

MEDa-0298

From anecdotal evidence, many pharmacists use green ink when marking on paper drug charts.

###### 3.8.3 LHP Information Panel

The guidance points in this section relate to the Information Panel attached to the Left-Hand Panel of the medication lines in the Drug Administration View. Figure 54 highlights the area in which it is located:

##### 3.9 Chart Area

The Chart Area is the time window for the Drug Administration View in which icons representing administration events are plotted for each drug and supplemented with descriptive text where appropriate.

This section contains guidance on the presentation of information within the Chart Area.

###### 3.9.1 Chart Area Structure and Layout

The guidance points in this section relate to the Chart Area for the administration event icons and details in the Drug Administration View. Figure 56 highlights the area in which it is located:

Figure 56: Chart Area

Administration events for each individual drug are plotted against both a vertical and a horizontal time scale as on the traditional TGP drug chart for recording prescriptions. The vertical time scale on the right of the Left-Hand Panel represents times of day such that time progresses from top to bottom. Columns in the horizontal time scale represent days and events that are plotted such that time progresses from left to right.

In order to interpret some of the guidance points below, it is necessary to clarify different types of ‘As Required’ prescription that might be supported by a system. The following three types have been provided by the NHS CFH ePrescribing team:

1. Unscheduled As Required

The medication can be given whenever necessary as long as it does not contravene its minimum interval or maximum frequency rules

2. Unscheduled As Required with Indicative Frequency

The same as type 1 but the medication has a suggested frequency to guide those administering it as to how often it should be administered (such as ‘morphine one to four times hourly As Required’). The suggested frequency is only present as an instruction and is not plotted as one or more planned events

3. Scheduled As Required

The medication is scheduled to specific times (as for Regular medications), but at each scheduled administration time those administering it should consider whether the medication should be given or not. These medications would be plotted as for other scheduled medications and so follow the appropriate guidance on list ordering and event positioning

MEDa-0067, MEDa-0068

Four rounds of user feedback with small numbers of clinicians showed strong support for the TGP drug chart style of displaying administration events on two time axes (hours and days). This was due to its familiarity for acute care clinicians **{R13, R14, R15, R16}** . Laying the chart out in a similar way to current paper charts is likely to reduce the training load on staff as drug administration moves from paper to electronic.

It is envisaged that other views (such as a Timeline View **{R5}** ) can provide the ability to view administration events on a single horizontal timescale, which allows graphing of other data (such as patient observations) against the administration events.

MEDa-0269, MEDa-0232

Icons need to clearly represent the time they are plotted against. Therefore, they have to have a consistent match between the icon’s outline shape and the time it is associated with. If an icon is to be plotted with its ‘centre’ aligning with a time, then the icon’s outline shape must not mislead clinicians as to which time it relates to. For this reason, the icon should be symmetrical about a horizontal axis.

MEDa-0270

Plotting scheduled events against their intended time follows current practice and gives an accurate visual representation of when events are Due and how far apart they are.

MEDa-0271

Unscheduled As Required drugs do not have an intended time of administration and so cannot be plotted at specific times. Plotting an event tied to the current time allows an unscheduled As Required drug to be administered whenever it is appropriate. Plotting the event in this way also helps to remind those administering it that the drug can be given. See section 3.11 for more guidance on As Required administrations.

MEDa-0272

Administration events that have a ‘recorded’ status have three times associated with them:

 The intended time of administration

 The recorded time of administration

 The time of recording

The clinician is most likely to be interested in the intended time and the recorded administration time, and potentially the size of the difference between these. It is especially important to highlight a significant difference between the intended time and recorded time as this may indicate delayed treatment and put administration events closer together then intended by the prescriber. Figure 62 and Figure 63 showed that positioning the events at either time still allows the other time to be communicated (or at least inferred) but with reduced emphasis. There are risks with either approach:

 The risk with plotting the events at the recorded time (Figure 62) is that if the event has been administered late or early, the

intended time is less clear, and once again how late or how early is not immediately apparent

 The risk with plotting the events at the intended time (Figure 63) is that if the event has been administered late or early, how late or

how early is not made apparent by the position

Another option would be to display both times as two linked events, but this raises the potential for confusion and creates a more cluttered view.

Anecdotal reports suggest that the current practice on paper charts is to ‘re-plot’ significantly late events in a time closer to the recorded rather than the intended time of administration. However the decision to ‘re-plot’ is at the documenter’s discretion.

Implementers of this guidance should consider these risks with the different approaches to plotting administration events and their possible mitigations.

MEDa-0273

As unscheduled As Required medications do not have an intended time of administration, plotting them at their recorded time of administration gives the most accurate record of the administrations. This follows current practice of documenting the time of administration for As Required medication.

Figure 99: Example Past Overdue Areas

There are conditions which determine when an event’s status changes from ‘Next’ to Due and from Due to ‘Overdue’. The conditions are most likely to be time tolerances (as described in section 3.4). For example, an event might become Due 15 minutes before its scheduled time and become ‘Overdue’ 1 hour after its scheduled time. Similarly, a system developer might consider including an additional condition which causes an ‘Overdue’ event to automatically change at some point. This does not mean that such a condition is supported by this guidance.

The design for ‘Significant Duration’ drugs is intended to be used for those drugs where it is useful to record and subsequently view duration and other attributes such as rate. Gases and Infusions are examples of Significant Duration drugs. The guidance does not imply that all drugs that have an ‘important’ administration duration (such as aminophylline injections over 5 minutes) must be displayed according to the Significant Duration design. The decision about which medications to display using the Significant Duration guidelines will vary according to clinical context.

MEDa-0166

Taken with guidance point MEDa-0165, this means that when a patient is Nil by Mouth the clinician has to take three steps for every administration event for oral medication:

1. Open the administration recording form for that event

2. Select the option to not give the medication due to Nil by Mouth

3. Confirm the administration (for example, through a ‘Record Administration’ button)

This may seem like a lot of steps to ‘accept’ a Nil by Mouth; however it is the same number of steps that would be made for recording any administration as Not Given. The system cannot accept the administration after the second selection as the clinician may want to add other information in options present on the administration form.

##### 3.15 Complex Drugs

###### 3.15.1 Variable Dose Drugs

The guidance points in this section relate to the display of administration events for drugs where the prescriber has specified that the dose will vary. Figure 124 highlights an example of where this could be located:

Figure 124: Example Variable Dose Drugs Display Area

There are a number of ways that a dose may vary. Table 7 describes the ways a dose may vary and indicates whether each type is addressed in this guidance:

![](drugadmin_assets/drugadmin.pdf-93-0.png)

Conditional Dose Dosage likely to vary per administration or per day based on criteria such as drug levels

Dose Range Dosage range specified by the prescriber within which those administering it can choose a dose depending on patient need

Constant Dose–Pattern Dosage variations repeating either within or between days based on a schedule defined by the prescriber

Varying Dose–Pattern Dosage schedule defined by the prescriber that does not fall into a repeating pattern

Loading Dose An initial higher dosage at the start of a course that reduces to a regular, consistent dose

Adjusted Dose Dosage changed by a prescriber after the initial prescription where this change was not specified by the original prescriber. (This is not counted as a variable dose by this guidance).

As Required analgesia

furosemide morning and evening

prednisolone tapering dose

Yes

The guidance in this section covers drugs whose dose has been prescribed to vary. The guidance does not apply to adjusted doses as these are cases where the dose varies after the initial prescription.

In current practice, some of the variable drug types in Table 7 are commonly prescribed on ‘one line’. For example, it is common to find special lines on paper charts that allow for differing oral

Page 89

HSCIC Controlled Document

anticoagulant doses every day. On some paper charts, variable drug types such as constant dose patterns (for example morning and evening furosemide doses) may be written as two separate prescriptions (on two lines). Other paper charts allow for varying doses within a day so can be written up as one prescription on one line.

The guidance does not require that variable dose drugs are displayed as a single prescription on a single line but does offer direction on how this display should work if the application does display medication in this way. For example, the two representations of furosemide in Figure 125 and Figure 126 both have guidance compliant Chart Areas: Figure 125 displays the furosemide as one prescription on one line, whereas Figure 126 displays the two doses as separate prescriptions on separate lines:

Figure 125: Two Dose Prescription Displayed as a Single Medication Line

Figure 126: Two Dose Prescription Displayed as Two Medication Lines

If the application does display variable doses over multiple lines (as in Figure 126) then it is likely there will need to be some indication of linkage between these lines. This guidance document does not address the design of this linkage.

This guidance does not address loading doses as it has not been determined whether they should ever be displayed on single lines (that aggregate the loading and subsequent doses) or whether the guidance for variable doses would be appropriate for loading doses also.

###### 3.15.5 Displaying Partially-Logged Administrations

There may be a requirement for a clinician to be able to record an administration, but not complete the minimum data required for a complete administration (for example, when under emergency conditions). This is referred to as a partially-logged administration.

This guidance does not cover partially-logged administrations.

**Important**

Implementers of systems that support such a function must carefully consider what constitutes a safe user interface for both the recording and subsequent display of partially-logged administrations.

MEDa-0207

Administration recording is speeded up by pre-filling values where it is safe to do so. Example values would include ones that are implicit on the paper drug charts, such as the time of administration.

MEDa-0239

As per MEDa-0190, administration can be logged against Future events but the administration must have occurred in the past and be recorded as such. For example, at 10:00 a clinician can record the 12:00 dose as Given as long as he or she records it as having been given before 10:00. That is, prospective administration recording is not supported.

##### 3.17 Medication Updates

In the event that a patient’s prescriptions are updated while the Drug Administration View is open, these updates must be immediately reflected in the view. Updates would include new prescriptions, discontinued prescriptions and edited prescriptions.

![](drugadmin_assets/drugadmin.pdf-106-0.png)

HSCIC Controlled Document

MEDa-0295, MEDa-0296

However, if the view dynamically updates without a clear indication of the change, clinicians may not appreciate its exact nature resulting in confusion or mis-administration. For example, if a clinician is preparing to administer a medication displayed at the top of the screen, he or she may read the name of the medication, look away to get the medication out of the relevant drawer and then look back at the view to check the dosage. If the top item has meanwhile been replaced by another medication (without a clear indication that this has changed), there is a danger that the clinician may not notice the name change and reads the dosage of the new item as the dosage to give of the medication in their hands.

Freezing the view and providing a message to draw attention to the nature of the update helps mitigate the risk that the update is not noticed or understood. This guidance is rated as recommended as the method described and risks of doing this have not been fully explored. For example, it is possible that the view could dynamically update but very clearly mark what change has occurred. However, this behaviour would have to be very carefully specified in order to be safe and the required exploration was not in scope for this guidance.

MEDa-0297

The documentation should always reflect reality. Therefore, if a medication is changed between a clinician reading the instruction to administer and the documentation of this administration, the administration must still be recorded as it happened. It is reasonable to clarify to clinicians how they should proceed as this kind of change will be unfamiliar to users of paper drug charts, especially since the administration may be seen as an error.

As Required A drug that has not been given a regular schedule and therefore is only given on an ad-hoc basis based on clinical judgement and preset criteria.

Begun A Significant Duration drug, for which a start date and time have been recorded, is scheduled to still be running and has nothing recorded to indicate that it has stopped.

Conformance In the guidance tables, indicates the extent to which you should follow the guideline when defining your UI implementation. There are two levels:

 **Mandatory**          - An implementation should follow the guideline

 **Recommended**          - An implementation is advised to follow the guideline

Current best practice Current best practice is used rather than best practice, as over time best practice guidance may change or be revised due to changes to products, changes in technology, or simply the additional field deployment experience that comes over time.

Current medication Current medications refer to those that have been prescribed to a patient and have not yet been discontinued or completed. A medication can also be termed current with reference to a time in the past when the medication was current for the patient

Due Within the time constraints that allow the administration to be recorded as given successfully (‘Given’).

Evidence Rating In the guidance tables, summarises the strength of the research defining the guideline and the extent to which it mitigates patient safety hazards. There are three ratings (with example factors used to determine the appropriate rating):

 **Low:**

 Does not mitigate specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings unclear and with few participants

 Unreferenced usability principles indicate the design is not significantly better than alternatives

 **Medium:**

 Mitigates specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings clear but with few participants

 References old authoritative guidance (for example, from National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA),

Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) or World Health Organization (WHO)) that is potentially soon to be superseded

 Referenced usability principles indicate the design is significantly better than alternatives

 **High:**

 Mitigates specific patient safety hazards

 User research findings clear and with a significant number of participants

 References recent authoritative guidance (for example, from NPSA, ISMP or WHO)

 Referenced usability principles indicate the design is significantly better than alternatives

NHS Entity Within this document, defined as a single NHS organisation or group that is operated within a single technical infrastructure environment by a defined group of IT administrators.

Overdue Outside the time constraints for recording an administration as ‘Given’ but still within time constraints for recording a late administration (‘Given Late’).

#### APPENDIX A STUDY ID 8: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

##### A.1 Abstract

The UK National Health Service (NHS) Common User Interface (CUI) programme is a partnership between Microsoft [®] and NHS Connecting for Health (NHS CFH), which is part the NHS National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT).

As part of CUI, the Clinical Applications and Patient Safety (CAPS) project has the goal of ensuring that software applications used by the NHS enhance patient safety. To achieve this, CAPS provides software developers with user interface design guidelines derived through a user-centric development process that includes explicit patient-safety evaluations.

This summary describes key findings from user research carried out in June 2008 by the CUI CAPS team on Drug Administration. These findings are a subset of those in a larger internal report prepared for the CUI CAPS Drug Administration team.

**Purpose:**

To gain clinical feedback on design concepts for Drug Administration in electronic systems.

**Method:**

Interviews: structured interviews with 15 Health Care Professionals (HCPs) eliciting HCP preferences and qualitative feedback on design alternatives.

Survey: six respondents answered open and closed questions on a subset of the same designs shown in the interviews.

**Key Results:**

Based on clinician preference and rationale:

- Sorting by ‘dueness’ seems appropriate for the task of drug administration. However,

concerns were raised that this was not the most appropriate sort order for non-administration tasks

- There was mixed feedback on whether to group drugs by default or not

- The current model for pharmacist verification was supported

- The notional 'dueness' state transition model was supported (though alternatives were not

considered)

##### A.2 Research Objectives

To gather HCP preferences and qualitative feedback on, and to identify possible patient safety hazards with, CUI Drug Administration designs.

##### A.3 Research Design

###### A.3.1 Interviews

Interviews were structured, lasted one hour and were carried out in person. Participants were taken through design alternatives for each area and asked for preferences based on patient safety rationale. Qualitative feedback was also elicited.

Detailed notes from the interviews were qualitatively analysed using thematic coding.

###### A.3.2 Survey

Respondents completed a 30 minute online survey containing a subset of the images used in the interviews. As with the interviews, respondents were asked for preferences among the design alternatives, based on patient safety rationale, and asked for qualitative feedback.

##### A.4 Results

###### A.4.1 Interview Participant Description

15 participants were interviewed in 13 sessions. Each had either volunteered through the NHS CFH Event Management System (EMS) signup or had been recruited by an HCP who had volunteered. Table 3 shows a summary of the participants’ profiles:

Bullet text _in italics_ represents researcher recommendations or comments in order to distinguish them from user feedback.

_**Example Pharmacist Tasks with Drug Charts**_

- Is there anything that I need to verify?

- Is there anything that I need to supply?

 And how soon do I need to supply it: is an administration imminent?

- Are there any patterns of non-administration that might need to be addressed?

- How is the XXXX medication doing?

- Why is the patient’s blood pressure still high? Have they had their blood pressure

medication yet?

- Should any of the As Requireds be changed to Regulars (or vice versa)?

- Is the patient’s discharge medication correct?

- Does the patient need a compliance aid at home?

_**As Required**_

- Four participants raised concerns about showing timescale with times for As Required

medications. The presence of times on the timescale implies it was Regular medication with scheduled events

- The ‘As Required for...’ text was seen as useful

- Three participants suggested that it would be helpful to see the administration times for

the As Requireds of previous days by default so that they could determine if the medication needed to be converted to a Regular

- Questions were raised over whether both the minimum interval and maximum frequency

should be displayed and how they should be phrased:

 _Deferred to NHS CFH ePrescribing team_

Page 110

Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre

HSCIC Controlled Document

_**Sorting by Dueness**_

- All participants were positive about sorting by dueness (“quite a good idea”) or very

positive (“a really good idea”) for the task of drug administration

- One nurse had used an eMAR with sorting by dueness before and found it “fine”

- Considering non-administration tasks, the pharmacists interviewed felt that ordering by

dueness would not be the most appropriate sort order for them or for doctors:

 And therefore they would like access to an alternative sort order or a different view to

see the administration schedule and history

- Several pointed out that, as many medications were likely to be Due at the same time,

secondary sort orders would be useful:

 Such as by ‘priority’ (for example, those with a narrow time tolerance)

_**Grouping by Default**_

- Preferences were very mixed on whether medications should be grouped by default or not

- Differences centred around the pros and cons of ‘mixing’ of As Required with the rest of

the medications

- Roughly, more nurses would prefer not grouped by default and more pharmacists would

prefer grouped by default:

 _Presumably because sorting by ‘dueness’ is of less use to the pharmacist than a nurse_

_carrying out administrations (and not grouping allows the most Due to rise to the top_
_of the list not just the top of the group)_

- Why not grouping by default?

 Users wanted to prioritise sorting by dueness

 Having As Required and stat drugs in a separate section would perpetuate the problem

of these being accidentally ‘missed’

 One nurse had used a system with no grouping by default, describing that it “was fine”

 The issue of seeing a familiar view (for example, grouped like the paper drug charts)

can be satisfied by applying the grouping afterwards (if the user wants to)

- Why grouping by default?

 Having no groups would be “TOO big a change” (253) in that familiarity and

acceptance was more important overall

 “Nurses have a learnt routine of groups which they go through” (253)

 As Required ‘mixed in’ would lead to over administration (250)

 An As Required ‘query’ (‘can we give them anything for pain?’) would be easier to

answer if it was in a separate section

_**Never-Administered As Required**_

- Of eight participants asked, six felt it would be important to see discontinued As Requireds

on the chart even if they had never been administered

Page 111

HSCIC Controlled Document

_**Status Bar**_

- Preferences for the Status Bar design were inconclusive, however several respondents felt

that the whole Status Bar was unnecessary if the information was clear in the list:

 However, one participant realised that if you could apply grouping or alternative sort

orders (which is likely), then the Status Bar would alert you to Due and Overdue medication that you might be able to currently see and therefore was a useful feature

_**Pharmacist Verification**_

- Both nurses and pharmacists confirmed it was useful to see verification

- The two pharmacists asked felt that each medication was verified on its own and a global

verification was not necessary

- All six participants asked felt it was not necessary to permanently display the verifier’s

name, as long as it could be easily accessed

- Feedback was inconclusive on the use of a flag for verified or unverified

_**Due – The State Transition Model**_

- The potential time-based model was discussed with participants. The model includes:

 Flagging an event as Next when it is the next non-Due or Overdue event for that

medication

 Flagging an event as Due when it passes its scheduled time and becomes Overdue

around an hour after that

 Flagging whether administration was recorded early or late

- All seven participants with whom it was discussed felt the model was acceptable for the

general inpatient context:

 They also supported the idea of variable time tolerance within this model

_**Discontinued**_

- One participant was concerned that discontinued medications were currently not sufficiently

distinguished

Interviews: structured interviews with 14 Health Care Professionals (HCPs) eliciting HCP preferences and qualitative feedback on design alternatives.

Survey: 45 respondents answered open and closed questions on a subset of the same design images used in the interviews.

**Key Results:**

Based on clinician preference and rationale:

- ‘Long’ Overdue administration events should not re-sort in the list until after clinician action

- ‘Long’ Overdue administration events probably should not change to another state (for

example, Not Recorded) without clinician action

- A less mis-interpretable description for a Not Recorded state might be ‘Unknown’

- The Status Bar refresh control does not need to display multiple times and can simply

indicate that the list order needs updating

##### B.2 Research Objectives

To gather HCP preferences and qualitative feedback on, and to identify possible patient safety hazards with, CUI Medication Administration designs focusing on unfinished scope areas such as dealing with Not Recorded.

##### B.3 Research Design

###### B.3.1 Interviews (Study ID 40)

Interviews were structured, lasted one hour and carried out in person. Participants were taken through design alternatives for each area and asked for preferences based on patient safety rationale. Qualitative feedback was also elicited.

Detailed notes from the interviews were qualitatively analysed using thematic coding.

###### B.3.2 Survey (Study ID 14)

Respondents completed a 30 minute online survey containing a subset of the images used in the interviews. As with the interviews, respondents were asked for preferences among the design alternative, based on patient safety rationale, and asked for qualitative feedback.

##### B.4 Results

###### B.4.1 Interview Participant Description

14 participants were interviewed in 12 sessions. Each had either volunteered through the NHS CFH Event Management System (EMS) signup or had been recruited by an HCP who had volunteered. Table 3 shows a summary of the participants’ profiles:

All participants were from acute secondary care and were from three different teaching hospital trusts with diverse geographical locations.

Only 4 out of 12 participants had used an electronic medication administration record (eMAR) before. The majority had ‘medium’ computer experience as they had to use computers as part of their clinical work.

###### B.4.2 Survey Respondent Description

45 respondents completed the survey. All had either taken part in previous CUI feedback or were forwarded the survey by a colleague. Table 16 shows a summary of the respondent’s job roles:

53% of respondents had used some kind of ePrescribing and 27% had used some kind of electronic drug administration. Most respondents had medium to high computer experience.

###### B.4.3 Design Areas

Bullet text _in italics_ represents researcher recommendations or comments in order to distinguish them from user feedback.

Results from the interviews and survey have been combined where they covered the same design areas.

_**Not Recorded: Indication**_

- Only 45% of interview participants and 64% of survey respondents correctly interpreted

what the Not Recorded indicator would mean (the label was supplemented with a cross):

 _Implying that the label and cross symbol are not safe for use to represent this concept_

 _‘Unknown’ was suggested as a more appropriate term_

_**Not Recorded: Current Practice**_

- Pharmacists described unrecorded administration as a very common problem, expecting

to see several a day on their rounds:

 “Very serious, very prevalent and universal.....not catastrophic but it is the insidious

nature of the problem”

- Participants felt that it was very unusual not to be able to discover what actually

happened to the administration

- Participants speculated that blanks are often caused by interruptions in drugs rounds

_**Not Recorded: Time Change**_

- When shown an example of what might happen to an event that had been Overdue for

two hours, the majority of participants and respondents:

 Anticipated it would stay Overdue

 Reasoned that it should stay Overdue

 Or saw problems with it changing to a Not Recorded state after two hours

Page 115

HSCIC Controlled Document

_**Not Recorded: Sorting and Changing**_

- As well as changing state, participants were asked about whether the ‘long’ Overdue event

should re-sort so that other Due events came to the top of the list (as the list is ordered by dueness)

- Table 17 shows participant’s and respondent’s preferences for the behaviour of an

Overdue event after two hours:

Option 1 – Change to Not Recorded and re-sort 0 8%

Option 2 – Change to Not Recorded and not re-sort 36%

*If longer time till change

22%

Option 3 – No change and not re-sort 64% 67%

Don’t know 0 2%

Table 17: Preferences for Behaviour of an Event Over Two Hours Overdue

- Preference was to not change and not re-sort, with clear rationale such as that if you

change and re-sort the unrecorded events will get forgotten:

 However, an important risk raised was that if ‘unrecorded’ events did remain as

Overdue an administerer might administer BOTH doses in quick succession

_**Not Recorded: Recommendations**_

- _Until after clinician action, administration events that have gone beyond Overdue should:_

 _Not re-sort automatically_

 _Remain prominent in the display (perhaps through the Status Bar, label or visual_

_design)_

 _Indicate the original Due time_

 _Not use a mis-interpretable label or icon (for example, do not use Not Recorded or a_

_cross)_

 _Be very clear that there has NOT been any user-initiated change (perhaps by remaining_

_Overdue)_

 _Strongly encourage a user to deal with that administration event before any others for_

_that medication_

- _A clinician should be able to record that the administration status of an event is unknown_

_(as an exceptional circumstance)_

- _Consider whether an automatic change of state (that does not violate the above_

_recommendation) after either a ‘longer’ period of time or ‘when the Next event becomes_
_Due’ is feasible, compared to just remaining Overdue_

- _Illustrate all administration states on days not in focus on the administration view,_

_ensuring that they are still interpretable_

- _Address the risk that multiple Overdue events are mistakenly administered in quick_

_successio_ n

_**Self-Administration**_

- Participants described a variety of practice around self-administration, including one trust

which did not support it

- Table 18 shows survey respondent’s preferences for assessing compliance with Level 3

self-administration:

Nurse makes no documentation 0%

Nurse documents stated compliance daily 29%

Nurse documents stated compliance per drug round 55%

Other practice 10%

Don’t know 6%

Table 18: Preferences for Self-Administration Level 3 Compliance Documentation

- _Self-administration was placed out of scope shortly after this research as current clinical_

_policy is unclear and it is not the CUI’s responsibility to determine such policy_

_**As Required in the Status Bar**_

- Both interview participants and survey respondents preferred the design option which

showed a count of ‘givable’ and all As Required medications in the Status Bar:

 Reasons given were that it provided more information and made you think about the

As Required status

- _However, as several participants were confused by the count of ‘givable’ it should be_

_considered how this can be made more explicable to clinicians without increasing clutter_

_**Status Bar Refresh Control**_

- Of the three design options shown, participants felt the option indicating time of last

update and time of last input was overly wordy and confusing:

 In addition, a small time since last list order update does not mean that there are no

important order updates

- The option that just indicated that an list order update was available was seen as simplest

- The option in the style of a Internet browser alert bar was seen as a little confusing,

though most noticeable

_**Preconditions**_

- Feedback implied that there are at least two types of non-time-based preconditions:

a. The clinician has to record or view a measure (for example, pain score) before

administering

b. The clinician has to record or view a measure AND it has to be over a certain value (for

example, for digoxin) before administering

_(Type b preconditions are out of scope for the CUI Drug Administration work_ )

- A number of complicating factors were raised:

Page 117

Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre

HSCIC Controlled Document

 Indication that a score is not the only factor in a decision to give a PRN

 Dealing with a choice between multiple As Requireds (for example, with analgesics)

 A value may already be recorded recently as part of observation rounds so MIGHT

need to be imported or checked rather than input again

 The clinician may need to record a score AFTER administration to document the effect

of treatment

 There may need to be an indication of WHICH score to use (for example there may be

multiple pain scores in use)

- _Along with other issues, such as indicating trough-level requirements, this implies that the_

_CUI preconditions guidance will have to include a caveat that it does not cover the full_
_complexity of preconditions_

_**Indicating ‘Out-of-Round’**_

- As seen in other feedback, concern was raised at circling administration times to indicate

administrations ‘out of normal’ times as this clashed with the current paper convention to circle the times of administration
