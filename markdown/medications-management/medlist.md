**Patient Safety Process**


The development cycle for this design guide is compliant with the Clinical Safety Management
System (CSMS) – the patient safety risk assessment and management process defined by NHS
Connecting for Health (NHS CFH) in conjunction with the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA).


The design guide developers reviewed patient safety incidents arising from both current practice
and existing systems for medications management. The resulting guidance points support
mitigation of these known patient safety risks. In addition, the developers identified any potential
new risks by applying a patient-safety risk-assessment process. The developers are assessing and
managing all risks to support a Clinical Safety Case for this design guide.


The Hazard Log records all hazards and risks raised to date and includes mitigation actions that, in
some cases, will be applicable to you if you are an implementer or other user of this design guide.
The Hazard Log is a live document and updates regularly whilst this design guide continues its
development. Until this design guide has received full Clinical Authority to Release (CATR) from the
NHS CFH Clinical Safety Group (CSG) – based on an approved Clinical Safety Case – there may
be outstanding patient safety risks yet to be identified and mitigated. Therefore, it is essential that
you review the relevant Hazard Log in conjunction with this design guide.


Refer to nww.cui.nhs.uk (N3 connection required) for all current patient safety documentation,
including Hazard Logs and the current patient safety process status for this and other design
guides.

### 1 INTRODUCTION


This document provides guidance for the display of a list of medications for one patient in a user
interface (UI). It describes what is meant by a list of medications, defines the scope, lists mandatory
and recommended guidance points with usage examples and explains the rationale behind the
guidance.


This document replaces the previously published guidance _Medications Management – Medication_
_Views_ **{R1}** . A significant number of the changes to the guidance are designed to allow flexibility
and encourage innovation. The guidance has been amended to ensure that it is relevant to lists of
medications that may have different structures and content and it has been extended to provide
specific guidance where a standard is needed to mitigate patient safety hazards.


Table 1 describes the changes made since the previous version of this guidance (Baseline version
2.0.0.0 dated 12-Oct-2008):



**Deleted** MEDv-001 to
MEDv-015


MEDv-016 to
MEDv-018



Deleted to remove constraints that relate to specific views other than a medication list, navigation between
views and guidance relating to a framework of views


Removed because they are general versions of the more specific guidance in the sections on Current and
Past (MEDv-063), Past Filters (MEDv-066) and Grouping (MEDv-084) respectively



MEDv-019 Removed as further research is being carried out that may inform the production of guidance for the
display of and navigation between different sets of medications information (Levels of Detail)


MEDv-033 Removed because decision support alerts need to be considered as part of a larger framework



MEDv-034
MEDv-040



Superseded by more detailed guidance in _Medications Management – Medication Line_ **{R2}** guidance
document, section 3.3.4



MEDv-039 Replaced by MEDi-001 in _Medications Management – Medication Line_ **{R2}** guidance document


MEDv-041 Replaced by MEDi-018 in _Medications Management – Medication Line_ **{R2}** guidance document


MEDv-026 Removed because the formatting defined in MEDv-024 and MEDv-025 is sufficient to distinguish
medications with a different status


MEDv-046 Replaced by MEDv-179, MEDv-180 and MEDv-181 as the look-ahead scroll bar (LASB) is now displayed
in a reserved space


MEDv-047 Replaced by the more specific MEDv-181


MEDv-057 Deleted because medication lines are no longer shown within a recent past notification



MEDv-060
MEDv-061



Superseded by MEDv-182 because the LASB is no longer recommended as a navigation tool



MEDv-073 Removed because this is covered by MEDv-068



MEDv-076
MEDv-078 to
MEDv-082



Removed to mitigate UI design and technical issues associated with the display of recent past medications
within the current medications list



MEDv-088 Removed to allow the user to control the grouping and group states (expanded or collapsed) in each of
Current and Past medications respectively and independently



MEDv-093 to
MEDv-098



Relate to the duplication of medications that belong in more than one group. Removed as this approach is
no longer recommended since guidance cannot effectively mitigate the risks that it has been found to
introduce.



MEDv-106 This sorting restriction (do not allow sorting by hidden attributes) has been removed to allow the provision
of mechanisms that can support sorting other than by clicking on visible column headings


MEDv-107 to Relate to the control and display of Levels of Detail. Removed because guidance can only assess risks by


Page 1

HSCIC Controlled Document


rather than extending it, we hope to encourage innovation in this area


MEDv-134 Removed to avoid the implication that the context menu should be used to display information about the
selected medications



MEDv-137 to
MEDv-140



Relate to display of detailed information about a single medication. These guidance points have been
removed because further work is needed to identify guidance in this area. If all details for one medication
are displayed in such a way that occludes the information in the list, there is a risk that the partially visible
medications information may be used to inform clinical judgement. This risk needs further assessment and
further design exploration is needed to explore the provision of information without occluding the
medications in the list. These risks are best addressed as part of a more comprehensive design for the
display of all details for one medication.



**Modified** MEDv-020 Rephrased and extended to clarify that each line represents one medication


MEDv-025 Rephrased to remove the potential for it to be interpreted as supporting the display of current and past
medications concurrently in the same list



MEDv-028 to
MEDv-032
MEDv-034 to
MEDv-038



Replaced with new guidance that is provides principles for the ordering and formatting of columns and for
wrapping rather than requiring the display of specific columns in a set order



MEDv-049 Rephrased to clarify that the order of drugs in the look-ahead notifications must be consistent with the
order of medications in the list


MEDv-056 Rephrased to clarify that the black dot in the look-ahead scroll bar notifications should have a space either
side


MEDv-067 Rephrased to clarify that a ‘show all past’ (or equivalent) option should be available in the list of filters for
past medications


MEDv-068 Rephrased to differentiate it from MEDv-070 and to clarify that it refers specifically to the presence and
location of a control for removing a filter


MEDv-072 Conformance rating changed from Mandatory to Recommended to allow for brevity in filter notification
messages


MEDv-083 Conformance rating changed from Mandatory to Recommended to allow for the default presentation of
grouping to support users focused solely on a specific task


MEDv-084 Rephrased to replace to ‘combo-box’ with the more accurate ‘drop-down box’


MEDv-089 Changed so that it only requires counts to be shown in group headings for groups that are collapsed


MEDv-090 Conformance rating changed from mandatory to recommended in order to allow for the display of group
headings for empty groups when the grouping scheme has few groups and is used for specific tasks that
require explicit confirmation of empty groups



MEDv-099
MEDv-100



Rephrased to clarify that ‘start date’ and ‘end date’ are not necessarily the correct definitions or column
labels for the dates to which the default sorts are applied



MEDv-103 Conformance rating changed from Mandatory to Recommended since it is supplementary to the use of an
icon to indicate the sort order in a column heading


MEDv-104 Rephrased to clarify that a text symbol such as a triangle could be used instead of an icon


MEDv-105 Rephrased to refer to the default sort rather than reference an explicit sort order


MEDv-127 Extended to describe the keyboard shortcuts explicitly



MEDv-022
MEDv-059
MEDv-064
MEDv-074



Wording revised for clarity, without altering the meaning

MEDv-201



These guidance points have been added



Table 1: Changes Since the Last Baseline Version


**Note**


In this document, the words ‘generic’ and ‘brand’, when associated with drug names, are used with very
specific meanings that may differ from their accepted meanings in other contexts. Refer to section 4.2 for
definitions of the specific terminology used in this document.

#### **1.1 Customer Need**


An electronic system for managing a patient’s medications must be able to support the complex
needs of a wide range of health care professions and health care settings. A successful display
solution must therefore balance those complex information needs with safety concerns, and ensure
consistency across views and between systems.


**Medications Incidents**  - The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) reports that the majority of
medication incidents reported between January 2005 and June 2006 (59,802 in total) related to the
administration of medicines (59.3 percent), followed by incidents related to the preparation and
dispensing of medications (17.8 percent) and the prescribing of medications (15.7 percent). Their
findings, documented in _Safety in doses: medication safety incidents in the NHS_ _[1]_, also state that
the most common types of medication incidents reported to the NSPA included incorrect dose,
incorrect strength or frequency, omitted medicine and wrong medicine.


**Existing Systems**  - In-patient hospital care settings currently use multiple kinds of medications
documents, both paper-based and electronic. As care professionals move between hospitals and
are faced with new information groupings while working in stressful environments, the differences
in the designs of the documents they use may well already impact patient safety. Differences in
display formats for medicines impact both the review and management of those medications and
will become a safety concern as electronic systems become more widely available in the next few
years. The challenge for designers developing electronic systems in this area is particularly great
as there are no universally-accepted paper-based standards to reference.


Research in which extensive studies of medication-related errors were reviewed, suggests that the
most powerful means of preventing medication-related errors are computerised order entry and
administration management along with standards for processes and for the writing of prescriptions
(see _Medication Errors_ **{R4}**, _To Err Is Human_ **{R5}** and _Understanding Patient Safety_ **{R6}** ).


In the UK, emerging standards and guidelines designed to improve medicines management in the
NHS draw attention to the need for active review of long term medications in a Primary Care
environment (see _Room for Review_ **{R7}** and _National Service Framework for Older People_
_(NHS)_ _[2]_ ) **.** For in-patient settings however, medication reviews are carried out as part of regular and
often daily reviews of treatment. Medications are reviewed to assess whether they are achieving
the desired therapeutic intent, ensure that there are no more medications prescribed than is
necessary and to monitor for adverse effects.


An in-patient review of medications may form only part of a more comprehensive review that
depends on other information such as observations, test results and clinical notes (including
diagnoses and plans). The information required for a medication review will vary for different

contexts so it is unlikely that the needs for all kinds of medications review would be met by the
design of one, specific UI. However, there are needs that are common to all kinds of medications
review. Guidance for these areas can help to mitigate errors caused or heightened by
inconsistencies of core medications information between systems.

#### **1.2 Scope**


This guidance has been designed for the display of medications for a single patient in a hospital
ward environment. The guidance applies to the display of information about medications in a list
that is organised using columns and rows and specifically to the way that the information is
organised and can be manipulated by the clinical user.

##### **1.2.1 In Scope**


Users Hospital-based doctors, nurses and pharmacists


Care settings In-patient, hospital ward environment only


Tasks Reviewing medications that have been prescribed for a single patient and checking the accuracy of
scripts



Medications  Oral solids and liquids

 Inhalers and sprays

 Eye, ear and nose drops

 Topical liquids

 Creams, ointments and gels

 Enemas and rectal solutions

 Granules and powders



 Insulin

 Suppositories and pessaries

 Topical patches

 Nebuliser solutions

 Simple infusions (by example only)

 Injections (insulin example only)

 Unlicensed medications



Grouping Controls for applying and changing sorting and grouping respectively. The display of group headers,
expanding and collapsing groups and handling medications that belong in more than one group


Notifications General notifications, such as ‘Patient nil by mouth’ and recent past medications


Look-ahead scroll bars Generic guidance for the display of a look-ahead scroll bar in any view and guidance that is specific to the
display of current medications and past medications. See section 3.3.20 for a description of the lookahead scroll bar.


List structure Structure and layout of a list of medications


Filtering Filtering to display current or past medications respectively and filters to display subsets of past
medications


Table 2: In Scope

##### **1.2.2 Out of Scope**


Table 3 defines areas that are not covered in this guidance. Although there may be specific risks
associated with these areas that are not addressed in this guidance, it is likely that the principles in
this guidance will extend to the display of medication information in many of the areas listed below.


The patient is indicated as out of scope in so far as not being a user of clinical software; the
guidance is designed to support user interfaces used by clinicians. As such, it will therefore present
information in formats that are designed to support health care professionals. The display of
medication information in views that are designed for patients is not addressed in this guidance.


The care settings listed in Table 3 are out of scope because they have not been studied in depth in
our research. The Medication List guidance is likely to be relevant to all of these care settings, but

there may be specific risks associated with each that have not been considered and therefore
mitigated in this guidance.

#### **1.3 Dependencies**


**D1** This guidance is informed by ongoing and unpublished work by the NHS National Programme for IT (NPfIT) that is referred
to in this document as NHS Connecting for Health (NHS CFH) Medication Types Rules. The NHS CFH Medication Types
Rules is still evolving and is based on extensive research and consultation. Changes to this work may trigger changes to this
guidance.


**D2** This guidance is informed by the NHS NPfIT _ePrescribing Functional Specification_ _[3]_


**D3** This guidance uses the concepts ‘generic drug’ and ‘brand name’ and depends on access to, or creation of, a database or
dictionary, that can support these concepts, such as the _Dictionary of Medicines and Devices_ (known as ‘dm+d’) [4] .


**D4** This guidance includes guidance points for filtering, sorting and grouping that are expected to be included in a separate
guidance document for this area. Availability of such a document may trigger changes to this guidance.


**D5** This guidance assumes that a list of medications is provided as part of a larger framework of medications that collectively
provide enough information to support a review of the current and past medications of a single patient. A comprehensive
understanding of the current status of a patient’s medications is expected to be gained from the use of more than one
medications view.

Table 5: Summary of Guidance


Copyright ©2013 Health and Social Care Information Centre

HSCIC Controlled Document

### 3 GUIDANCE DETAILS

#### **3.1 Introduction**


This section contains detailed guidance for the display of a list of medications that have been
prescribed for a single patient. A list of medications is expected to be one of many ways of
displaying medications information for a single patient. This list of medications forms only part of
the medications management views and tools that would be available in a clinical application.


A full framework for medications management in a clinical application might include:


 The definition of a set of views each of which has a different focus and presentation style


 The definition of specialist views that combine information in a particular way for use in

specific contexts. For example, a monitoring chart for tracking medication doses,
observations and test results in a high dependency unit, or a Timeline View for long term
management of diabetes


 Mechanisms for accessing medications management tools and navigating between

medications views. These may be dependent on the application architecture


 The degree to which, and means by which, medications information is integrated into other

parts of a clinical application


 The dimensions of each of the medications views and the way in which they integrate into

the surrounding application. This includes whether views are panels, separate windows or
full-screen views and defines how the user navigates between and interacts with them.
Figure 1 shows an example of a full width medications view and Figure 2 shows a
medications view displayed alongside another view.

HSCIC Controlled Document


The CUI program provides design guidance for selected medications views that are expected to be
commonly used and that would provide more benefit to the user by being consistent between
clinical applications.


A common set of medications views is expected to include:


 A Medications List View, in line with the guidance in this document


 A Drug Administration View, in line with the guidance in _Drug Administration_ **{R11}**


 A Timeline View, in which medications and associated events are plotted along a vertical

timescale. A Timeline View could be designed to support users reviewing sequences of
medications-related events and allow users to review medications being taken on a specific
day or within a date range


 A view in which medication doses can be tracked alongside related test results and

recorded observations


Medications information is not only displayed in views that are dedicated to medications
management. The _Medication Line_ **{R2}** design guidance defines display rules that remain
consistent wherever a medication is displayed. Figure 3 shows medications information displayed
in a view that focuses on other (non-medications) information:








|Patient Banner<br>Global Navigation<br>Other Toolbar|Col2|Col3|Medications information<br>displayed within a view<br>that is designed to display<br>other information|
|---|---|---|---|
|Patient Banner<br>Global Navigation<br>Other Toolbar||Other View|Other View|
|Other Toolbar|Other Toolbar|Other Toolbar|Other Toolbar|



Figure 3: Medications Information Displayed as Part of a View that is Designed to Display Other Information


Although not displayed within a Medications List View, Drug Administration View or Timeline View,
the medications information must still conform to the _Medication Line_ **{R2}** design guidance.

#### **3.2 Principles**


The following key principles inform the guidance in this section:


 Provide the information required to make a high-level clinical assessment of the patient’s

medications


 Restrict the display of unnecessary information to reduce clutter and prioritise information

most likely to require action


 Provide access in context to further details on demand


 Mitigate the potential for action to be taken without sufficient information by presenting

carefully selected information by default, avoiding occlusion and providing clear signposts
to further information.


 Describe inclusion criteria clearly by providing explicit labels to clarify what information is

displayed and the extent to which it is complete

##### **3.3.8 Date Columns**


The guidance in this section refers to date columns. The specific information to display in these
columns is not part of guidance because needs differ between tasks and contexts. Guidance is
provided for the relative placement of date columns when there are columns such as ‘Date
Prescribed’ or ‘First Administration’ that include date and time information.


In what follows, columns that contain date and time information for the start or initiation of a
medication are referred to as ‘start date’. Columns that contain date and time information for an end
or completion of a medication are referred to as ‘end date’. The guidance does not refer to the
relative placement of any other date columns (such as ‘Review Date’) that may be present.

**Design Analysis:**

This guidance aims to introduce a set of status values that::

 Are more detailed than simply ‘current’ and ‘past’

 Are relevant to all care settings and can be supplemented to add granularity

 Can be used in conjunction with other, more granular sets of status values.

Reserving space for the look-ahead scroll bar achieves the following:

 The scroll bar and look-ahead notifications have fixed positions so there is no impact from the resizing or repositioning of the scroll

bar or the contents of the list as the notifications appear and disappear

 The look-ahead notification cannot overlap a medication in the list, so some of the risks associated with occlusion are mitigated

 A clearer definition of when a medication should appear in the notification can be achieved


**User Feedback:**

The guidance is supported by a user feedback study with nine health care staff that showed strong support for a mechanism of
indicating that there are medications out of view. The look-ahead scroll bar is the example mechanism that was used in this study. The
guidance is also supported by an iterative assessment of an interactive prototype.

**User Research:**

The use of look-ahead notifications to support navigation has been explored extensively in user research studies, including a study
with an interactive prototype. It has also been explored extensively through the assessment of design alternatives.

#### **3.4 Rationale Summary**


This section summarises the principles behind the rationale for all guidance points in this
document.


General Principles:


 Provide support for legibility


 Mitigate risks of incorrect selection and misinterpretation


Usability Principles:


 Minimise the use of embellishments (for example, bold, colour, fonts, font sizes, italics,

separators and symbols)


 Minimise instances of each type of embellishment within a reading unit


 Consistent use of specific embellishments within and preferably between user-interface

contexts or ‘views’


 Use words instead of symbols where it is important for removing ambiguity


Existing Standards:


 NHS NPfIT – _ePrescribing Functional Specification_ **{R9}**


 NHS NPfIT – _Guidelines for the Design and Presentation of Medication Elements Required_

_in Electronic Prescribing or Medication Ordering Systems_ **{R15}**


 Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) (US) – _Draft Guidelines for Safe Electronic_

_Communication of Medication Orders_ _[7]_


Evolving Standards:


 Standard set of information needed to safely describe a medication

#### **4.2 Definitions**


NHS Entity Within this document, defined as a single NHS organisation or group that is operated within a single
technical infrastructure environment by a defined group of IT administrators.


The Authority The organisation implementing the NHS National Programme for IT (currently NHS Connecting for Health).


Current best practice Current best practice is used rather than best practice, as over time best practice guidance may change or
be revised due to changes to products, changes in technology, or simply the additional field deployment
experience that comes over time.


Generic drug name This can be a single drug name that refers to a single active ingredient or it can be multiple active
ingredients that are prescribed as one drug. In the structure of the dm+d **{R10}**, this generally equates to a
Virtual Therapeutic Moiety (VTM)


Brand name A brand name for a product containing medication. A brand name may be associated with many products.
In some cases, the same brand name may be associated with different generic drugs. Future versions of
the dm+d **{R10}** are expected to include a separate entity for brand name, known as Trade Family Name
(TFN). In the meantime, the brand name is part of the Actual Medicinal Product (AMP)
