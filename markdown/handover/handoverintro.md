### 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


This document is an introduction to the handover work carried out for the NHS Common User
Interface (CUI) Design Guide Workstream, Release 4. It should be read in conjunction with the
_NHS CUI Design Guide R4 Handover Requirements Spreadsheet_ **{R1}** (referred to in this
document as the Requirements Spreadsheet), which lists the user requirements generated during
the NHS CUI Release 4 work on handover.


This document covers:


 A brief introduction to handover in a clinical setting


 An overview of the NHS CUI work that has been carried out to investigate handover and

generate the user requirements


 Guidance on interpreting certain aspects of the Requirements Spreadsheet such as

categories, colour coding and terminology used


**Note**


This document does not provide an in-depth analysis of handover in a clinical context, a review of the
literature and previous (non-NHS CUI) work done on handover, or a detailed explanation of each
requirement and its rationale. See the literature references, the notes from the site visits, the artefacts
gathered, and the Requirements Spreadsheet.

### 2 INTRODUCTION TO HANDOVER

#### **2.1 Handover Definitions**


In their 2004 guidelines on handover, produced in response to the impact of the European Working
Time Directive (EWTD), the British Medical Association (BMA), the National Patient Safety Agency
(NPSA) and the Junior Doctor’s Committee defined handover in a clinical context as:


**“The transfer of professional responsibility and accountability for some or all aspects**
**of care for a patient, or group of patients, to another person or professional group on a**
**temporary or permanent basis”**

(BMA Junior Doctors’ Committee and NPSA in Safe Handover: Safe Patients, 2004) [1]


The NHS CUI work carried out on handover takes this statement as its starting definition of
handover.

To further explain the purpose of handover, Lardner’s (1996) [2] description of shift handover in
relation to process control industries is useful:


**“The goal of shift handover is the accurate, reliable communication of task-relevant**
**information across shift changes, thereby ensuring continuity of safe and effective**
**working”**


(Lardner in Health and Safety Executive report, 1996)


Lardner’s definition of shift handover also applies in a clinical context, and is broadly applicable to
other types of clinical handover, not only shift handover, in as much as the main aim of clinical
handover is to maintain continuity of care across some form of change in the system, be that a
change in: location of patient, staff member caring for patient, or type of care being provided for the
patient. Handover may have other aims or consequences, as described in section 2.2.


For the purposes of the NHS CUI programme, handover definition would include the patient group,
and also the list of relevant tasks to facilitate a transfer of professional responsibility. It was
considered that handover is not to include referrals. Though the distinction between handover and
referral may be difficult to make, the rationale for not including it in NHS CUI handover work is that
referrals should consist of an introduction to a patient’s history and demographics followed by a
note (which may be a task). It was assumed that a basic principle of the NHS CFH would have
already been achieved, and patient’s healthcare records are available to any clinician anywhere
within the health service.


Section 3.1 details the scope of the handover project.

#### **2.2 Background**


Handover is a common part of workflow in many industries, and has been the subject of research in
industries such as process control (for example, oil and gas industry), air traffic control and
healthcare. Handover, in particular shift handover, has been recognised as a potential point of
vulnerability for the ‘system’ (in the wider sense of the situation in hand) that the handover is
involved with. In industries other than healthcare it has been found that adverse events are more

likely to occur a short time after shift handover has occurred. Poor handover has been implicated
as a contributing factor in several large scale disasters such as Piper Alpha (Lardner 1996).


Handover in a clinical context has often been thought of as a process that occurs in Secondary
Care at nursing shift change, as nurses have traditionally worked a fixed shift system. As a result,
nursing shift handover has received the most study out of all types of clinical handover, and has
been to some extent standardised. However, with the advent of the European Working Time
Directive (EWTD) in 2003, junior doctors now have an explicit need for shift handover, and the
desire to investigate and support handover has increased. Recently, the NPSA has stated that
medical shift handover is “an area ripe with potential risks to patient safety” [3] . The BMA has also
called for more IT support of handover to minimise patient safety risks. It is envisaged that
electronically supported handover will not only improve patient safety and accuracy of information
transferred, but also produce information that will be useful for resource management,
commissioning, clinical and process auditing, and staff diary management.


In the experience of those working on the NHS CUI, Information Technology (IT) support for
handovers of any kind in a clinical context is rare, isolated, experimental and not integrated with a
full electronic clinical management system. In addition, it is not known to what extent the clinical
management systems that are planned for implementation in the NHS, support handover.


As discussed in section 2.1, handover has been identified as performing other functions aside from
transfer of information. The presentation and discussion of information relating to the items being
handed over can mean that handover is educational for those taking part. Some clinical handovers
(such as those involving senior doctors who are supervising junior doctors) make this function
explicit. Wears et al (2003) [4] has also identified handover as a point at which errors in a system may
be spotted and corrected, as staff ‘take stock’ of the situation. Wilson et al (2005) [5] observed that
the period of time around handover was often the only time when staff were fully aware of
everything that was going on in their area of responsibility (in that case a paediatric ward).


By summarising current information in the presence of other staff, handover can also be a point at
which key decisions are made, and in a clinical context, where a patient’s plan is formulated.
Handover has also been seen to have a social function, particularly where team members
handover together.


Due to the time and resource limitations on this round of handover investigation, the NHS CUI work
has focused primarily on how the information transfer aspect of handover could be supported by IT.

#### **2.3 Types of Handover in Clinical Contexts**


Table 1 below shows various examples of handover types.

It is outside the scope of this document to provide an in-depth analysis of the different types of handover
that occur in clinical contexts.

Table 1: Handover Types


Handovers can be categorised on many levels, with considerable overlap. The following list of
handover categories is not exhaustive, neither are the categories mutually exclusive:


 **Number of patients involved:** single patient / multiple patients


 **Level of handover detail:** summary only / full detail


 **Roles involved:** ward nurse, doctor, paramedic, district nurse, physiotherapist and so on


 **Handover within or between roles:** within a role / between two roles / multidisciplinary


 **Care change:** type of care changes / type of care stays the same


 **Scheduling:** ad-hoc / planned


 **Synchronous: Staff handing over** synchronously / asynchronously


 **Face-to-face:** staff handing over face-to-face / not face-to-face


 **Patient present:** yes / no


To assist in the assessment of categories, it is useful to consider what changes occur as part of the
handover. In a shift handover, the individual team members are changing, in a geographic transfer
handover the individual team members are changing, as is the location of the patient; in a
paramedic to A&E handover, the patient location, the individual staff member and the care type all
change.


Examples of common handover types can be broken down as follows:


 **Typical ward nursing shift handover:**


 Multiple patients handed over communally with a summary only, followed by a small
number of patients handed over individually in more detail


 Between the two nurses responsible (within roles)


 Co-located (face-to-face)


 Synchronous


 Planned


Page 4

HSCIC Controlled Document


 **Typical paramedic to A&E handover:**


 Single patient handed over with full detail (as full as possible).


 Between paramedic and A&E nurse (between roles)


 Patient changing location and care type


 Co-located (face-to-face)


 Synchronous


 Ad-hoc


The way that a specific handover is carried out in terms of: the roles present, specific location,
information transferred, supporting documentation, importance placed on it, duration, patient
present, and so on, varies greatly within the NHS due to a lack of handover standardisation.
Certain recommendations for standardisation have been made for various contexts (London
Ambulance Service guidelines, Royal College of Physicians Guidelines, Nursing training), with
differing degrees of enforcement. However, to a larger extent handovers happen according to local
conventions.


The differences between types of handover will have implications for different system design. For
example, in a paramedic to A&E situation, greater consideration will have to be given to the ad-hoc
and often rushed nature of the handover. This can also result in the documentation of the handover
occurring some time after the actual handover event.

#### **2.4 Users Involved in Handover**


In addition to the central role of the patient, whenever possible, handover will always involve at
least two users, or two sets of users. In general, these can be referred to as the ‘giver of handover’
and ‘receiver of handover’. In a specific kind of handover such as shift handover, a more specific
name can be given, for example, ‘incoming users’ and ‘outgoing users’. However, for the sake of
clarity across all types of handover, the terms ‘giver’ of handover and ‘receiver’ of handover will be
used in this document, as well as in the Requirements Spreadsheet. An example of where the giver
and receiver can both be sets of individuals is ward nursing handovers where one team will go
through their individual patients communally, and the other team will listen and question the givers.


In addition, there may be users in handover who are involved on both sides of the handover. For
example, in shift handover, other staff that are on a different shift pattern may be present, and
therefore they have worked on the shift now leaving, and will also be working with the new shift.


The receiver of handover doesn’t necessarily only receive information about the situation being
handed over. In shift handovers, it is likely that the receiver of handover (incoming users) will have
worked in the same location during their previous shift as the giver of handover (outgoing users),
and will therefore be able to add information about the handover items that have been the
responsibility of the system for more than one shift. For example, the receiver may have been on
shift when the patient was admitted and can give a more accurate description of the patient’s
condition on admission.

#### **2.5 Stages of Handover**


Figure 1 below shows the simplest breakdown of the handover process by dividing it into
conceptual stages:


Before During After


Figure 1: Stages of Handover - Simple Breakdown


Figure 2 below shows the stages of handover in more detail.


Preparation Negotiation Re-engagement


Initiation Acceptance


Figure 2: Stages of Handover - In Detail


In the first stage of handover, users will be preparing for the handover. Both the giver and receiver
may be preparing for handover, depending on the type of handover and how it is carried out in that
particular context. Handover preparation for the giver of handover may involve the gathering
together of information, and the comparison of information sources to determine what is the most
up-to-date information. This preparation is the ‘taking stock’ of the situation, where the giver is
assembling a representation of the state of the situation that they are going to handover. This may
be a very quick and purely mental process, or a longer process involving several members of staff
and the creation and/or updating of documents such as nursing shift reports or patient lists. Some
of these documents may be used in the handover itself. The receiver of handover may also prepare
for handover by making themselves aware of the situation prior to handover.


The initiation of handover occurs when both sets of users are ready to handover. For scheduled
handovers, this is fairly straightforward as they will usually occur at a fixed time and place. For
unscheduled handovers, such as paramedic to A&E staff, the handover initiation must be preceded
by a request to handover.


Although the negotiation is the main work of the handover process, the following interactions can
take place:


 Transfer of information


 Review of care and treatment


 Opportunities for education


 Development of trust and team working


 Joint decision making


In healthcare, this typically lasts between 1 minute and 30 minutes, depending on the context of the
handover.


At the end of the negotiation, the handover is concluded with an acceptance of the handover. This
acceptance is usually an indication made by the receiver of handover that they are happy to take
responsibility for the situation being handed over. The transition of responsibility may be indicated
by a physical token (for example, a bleep is handed over), or it may formalised, such as in a
paramedic to A&E transfer, where a signature is, in theory, required. More often than not, the
transfer of responsibility is implicit.

Figure 3 below shows an idealised view of who has the responsibility for items being handed over
during the handover. Whether the responsibility is transferred at the beginning of handover, or at
the end of the acceptance is a detail which is outside of the scope of the NHS CUI work. In
addition, there may be context-specific legal positions regarding the point at which the receiver of
handover becomes responsible for the items being handed over.


Giver of Handover Receiver of Handover


Preparation Negotiation Re-engagement


Initiation Acceptance


Figure 3: Users who are Responsible for Items during Stages of Handover


Specific items do not have to be mentioned in handover for the receiver to become responsible for
them. For example, hospital doctors on duty over a weekend may be responsible for hundreds of
patients but will only need to have the most urgent cases mentioned in the handover.


Once the handover has been accepted, the receiver takes responsibility for the items and starts
working with them. Looking at this from a high-level perspective, this period can be called ‘reengagement’ as this is the point where the staff are re-engaging with the items for which they are
responsible, even though an individual staff member may not have ‘engaged’ with the specific
items before. This period of re-engagement is identified in handover literature as a key point of
vulnerability for the ‘system’ (in the wider sense of the situation in hand), and therefore is a point of
concern for patient safety. The receiver of handover then gets to work on the tasks identified in
handover, clarify questions raised in the handover and so on.

### 3 NHS CUI HANDOVER PROJECT


This section describes the types of handover that were considered to be within the scope for the
Design Guide Release 4 work on handover. It also describes the work that was carried out to
investigate handover in order to build a basis for the NHS CUI design guidance on clinical
handover.

#### **3.1 Scope**

##### **3.1.1 In Scope**


 Shift handover


 Task management across handover


 Ongoing care on the wards


 Ongoing care in the community


 Paramedic to A&E handover


 Geographic transfer


 From A&E to a ward


 From ward to a ward


 To and from the operating theatre


 To and from investigations


 GP urgent transfer to acute setting


 To A&E


 To out of hours


 To ambulance

##### **3.1.2 Out of Scope**


 GP referral to specialist (‘blind’ referral)


 Request for consultations or other service


 Discharge from hospital to community for follow up


 Referral to hospital (except urgent community to hospital transfer)


 Referrals


 Definition of datasets for handover

##### **3.1.3 Discussion of Scope**


Referrals were not considered to be within the scope of the handover project during the NHS CUI
investigation (as shown in section 3.1). Although many types of handover were within scope, and
many types of handover were studied, (see list of site visits in APPENDIX A), there was an
emphasis on shift handover in hospitals, and towards multi-patient doctor’s shift handover in
particular. This bias was due to two factors: the perception of a greater need for a handoverspecific interface for these kinds of handover, and the previous experience of the NHS CUI
members working on the handover project.

Table 2: Staff Members Involved in Handover Work

##### **3.2.2 Research Activities**


Henry Dowlen performed almost all of the research activities. These activities included a large
number of site visits (as listed in APPENDIX A), during which, handovers were observed, or the
processes and artefacts used in handover were discussed. These sites covered a variety of care
settings, handover types and artefacts used to support handover. In particular, they included
several sites that had electronic support for handover.


Artefacts used to support handover were collected. Real (paper) copies, photocopies and
screenshots of artefacts that were collected are available as part of the supporting documentation.
In cases where the artefacts contain real patient data, this information has been made anonymous.


A selection of existing literature on handover was reviewed and used to inform the generation of
the user requirements for handover. For a list of the literature references used, please see
APPENDIX D.


A workshop was held with clinical users, which investigated their current experiences with
handover and their views on what might be done to improve their handovers.

##### **3.2.3 Project Outputs**


 **Primary output**


 List of user requirements. This is documented in the Requirements Spreadsheet **{R1}** .
Section 4 of this document provides information and guidance on this list.


 **Main secondary outputs**


 List of handover literature references and brief review


 A scenario which follows a patient through their care, and involves many different types
of handover


 Handover artefacts collected from clinical sites


 List of sites visits carried out to investigate handover


 Notes from site visits (by Henry Dowlen and James Fone)


 Facilitator notes and participant responses from the clinical user handover workshop


 Example datasets for handover (see 0)

#### **3.3 General Principles and Assumptions for Handover**


For the NHS CUI work on handover, several assumptions were made about the environment in
which clinicians would be handing over in the future. These assumptions were that:


 Multi-disciplinary electronic patient records would exist, and users involved in handover

would have easy and universal access to them (within the rights of their profile), including
mobile access


 Effective IT support of all kinds of handover would not be achieved by having access to

electronic records alone, unless the clinical management system housing the records
already had the functionality to satisfy the handover requirements


The general principles underlying the NHS CUI Programme’s consideration for handover were that:


 The information used and updated before, during and after the handover process was a

single reliable source. That is to say that users would no longer have to create ‘local’ paper
copies of information that become out of date quickly and when it is updated is does not
update a ‘central’ store of information. Users access a shared electronic record, and any
updates made on the information would update the shared record, not just a ‘handover
copy’


 The IT support of handover tries to facilitate the creation of an up-to-date representation of

the state of the ‘system’ being handed over. For example, a particular patient, or a whole
hospital full of patients. This up-to-date representation is ‘external’ to users in the form of
written documentation, but is also ‘internal’ to them, because the aim of the handover
support is to help the user form a mental representation of the situation being handed over


 As much of the kinds of data likely to be required for handover in a particular context will be

similar per patient (or item) handed over, IT support can perform much of the aggregation of
this information automatically. Therefore, users do not have to continue to use a manual
method to build an up-to-date representation of the state of the system. The patient
summary screens on most clinical management systems already perform a similar function
(on a per-patient basis). The degree to which the system can ‘automatically’ build this
representation will depend on the extent to which it ‘understands’ the information in patient
records


 The NHS CUI work would not try to define the datasets required for handover (at this stage)

given that these will be highly variable on context of handover

### 4 GUIDANCE ON THE REQUIREMENTS SPREADSHEET


In this section, guidance is given on how to interpret, and how best to use the Requirements
Spreadsheet **{R1}** .


**Note**


This document does not provide information on each requirement that is listed in the Requirement
Spreadsheet, nor their rationale. This is due to the large number of the requirements and the level of detail
that is provided in the Requirements Spreadsheet.

#### **4.1 How the Requirements Spreadsheet is Organised**


The Requirements Spreadsheet is made up of two worksheets: Requirements and Reqs Grouped
By Category, each presenting the requirements in a different format. The default listing of the
requirements (Requirements worksheet) is not in any particular order because the requirements
have been added to the worksheet as and when they were created. As a result, the Reference ID
(RID) numbers signify the requirement’s unique identifier only; where a requirement has been
removed from the Requirements Spreadsheet, the RID number has also been removed.


Each requirement has been worded in the present tense, and from a user’s point of view, therefore
the majority begin with “Users can…” The rationale for this being that when ‘users can’ actually
achieve the things laid out in the requirement (whether using a computer system or not) then the
requirement will have been satisfied.


The Plain English version of each requirement has been provided where it has been considered
that the wording of the requirement may need to be clarified for those readers who are not familiar
with: handover, system design, or with the requirements themselves.


The Examples provided (for many of the requirements) are either sourced from existing handover
solutions, or represent one possible way that a future handover solution might work.


Requirements have been grouped into ‘categories’, within the ‘category sets’ and are marked
accordingly in the spreadsheet. These categories and category sets are detailed in section 4.3.


**Note**


A requirement can belong to multiple categories within a category set as well as belonging to multiple
category sets.


To quickly understand and review the list of requirements, it is recommended that requirements are
reviewed in RID sequence. Alternative methods of reviewing the requirements are:


 Using the second worksheet ‘Reqs Grouped By Category’, where the requirements are

grouped by the Handover Aspect category (denoted by the orange colour-coding)


**Note**


Where requirements belong to multiple Handover Aspect categories, they are repeated in this’
list.


 Using the Excel ‘autofilter’ function to filter the list by category. Requirements can be filtered

by any of the categories


The Source of each requirement is provided by referencing the literature, artefact, site visit, or
analysis document from which it has been derived.

#### **4.2 Terminology Used in the Requirement Spreadsheet**


**Users** Refers to any of the staff members who are involved with handover, whether they are using a computer system or
not. It refers to both the givers and receivers of handover.


**Item** Handovers in a clinical context are usually about patients. However, handovers can also include non-patient items
such as “please check the resus trolley”, ”please contact pharmacy about low stock in the ward drug cabinets”. An
item is a conceptual unit about which individual bits of information refer. Where the item is a patient then the
information handed over about them will be attributes such as: name, age, diagnosis, current tasks and so on. Figure
4 illustrates the difference between a dataset and an item.


**Dataset** Each item that is handed over will have a ‘dataset’ associated with it. This is the actual information that is handed
over about the item. For a patient item, an example ‘dataset’ for shift handover might be: name, age, bed number,
diagnosis, current tasks, recently completed tasks, and dependency score. An individual bit of a ‘dataset’ is referred
to in the requirements as an ‘attribute’ or ‘dataset part’. For an illustration of the difference between a dataset and an
item, see Figure 4 below. This investigation did not attempt to define the datasets for use in handover due to the
wide variation between different handover contexts.


**Snapshot** Refers to a static view of the documentation used in handover, at the point at which the handover was accepted. It
therefore represents the recorded information that the receiver of handover accepted responsibility for at the time of
handover.


**Handshake** Refers to the process of accepting (or rejecting) the transfer of responsibility at the end of the handover. This process
involves both the giver and the receiver of the handover. This term has been taken from other industry’s descriptions
of handover process.


**Handover event** Refers to the entire handover, from initiation to acceptance. A record of the handover event might include a record

that the event took place as well as certain other details (for example, date and time, location, attendees and their
handover role, status of the handshake). May also refer to a live recording of the entire event (for example, an audio
recording).


Table 3: Terminology Used in the Requirements Spreadsheet

#### **4.3 Categories and Category Sets**

##### **4.3.1 Introduction**


The requirements have been organised into categories, mainly as a way of making them more
easily accessible and reviewable. This way, they can be considered in smaller, related groups.


The creation of the categories and the matching of requirements to the categories is subjective,
and it is recognised that the categories used in the Requirement Spreadsheet do not represent the
only way of categorising the requirements.


The requirement categories are grouped into three main category sets (each one is colour coded),
as detailed in sections 4.3.2, 4.3.3 and 4.3.4. Requirements can belong to more than one category
within a category set.


In addition to the three category sets used, several other category sets were proposed and
matched to requirements (Single patient / Multiple patients, Role handing over, Care setting).
However, these category sets have not proved useful for the purpose of categorising the
requirements and have been ‘hidden’ on the Requirements Spreadsheet.

HSCIC Controlled Document

##### **4.3.2 Category Set: Generic or Specific (Colour = Blue)**


This category set indicates whether requirements are specific to handover, or whether they apply to
general clinical management system use. Because much of handover is related to task
management (and a full clinical management system should enable electronic management of
tasks and staff member’s diaries), a separate category has been created for generic tasks and
diary management.


An example of a generic task/diary management requirement is RID 51: Users can allocate and
record tasks to particular sets of individuals (for example, jobs for the on-call team).


An example of a specific handover requirement is RID 22: The user receiving the handover is in
control of the transfer of responsibility in the handover. The Generic or Specific categories are:


 **Generic Clinical Management Requirement**


 **Generic Tasks/Diary Requirement**


 **Specific Handover Requirement**

##### **4.3.3 Category Set: Handover Stage (Colour = Pink)**


This category set reflects how handover can be divided into four basic stages. The majority of the
requirements that have been identified can apply at all stages of the handover because most
activities can be carried out at any point in the handover. The exception to this are the few
requirements that refer to the ‘handshake’ activity which occurs at the point of transfer of
responsibility, and those requirements that only apply during handover (for example, access to
information while in handover). The Handover Stage categories are:


 **Before Handover**


 **Handover Negotiation**


 **Handover Acceptance**


 **After Handover (Re-engagement)**

##### **4.3.4 Category Set: Handover Aspect (Colour = Orange)**


This category set has proved to be the most useful category set because it contains categories
which group the requirements by aspect or theme of handover. It has also been used as a basis for
the second worksheet ‘Reqs Grouped By Category’, where the requirements are grouped by this
category set. Most requirements in this category set have only been matched to one or two
categories of this set. The Handover Aspect categories are:


 **Dataset per Item:** requirements that involve the datasets per item such as the content of

the dataset, its behaviour, order, and so on. For an illustration of the difference between
‘datasets’ and ‘items’, see Figure 4. For a list of example datasets for different contexts that
were collected during the investigation, see 0. This investigation did not try and define the
datasets for use in handover due to the wide variation between different handover contexts


 **Example Dataset Part:** requirements that describe the need for a particular dataset part in

a particular context. (This category is a subset of the ‘datasets per item’ category)


 **Handshake:** requirements involving the transfer of responsibility part of the handover


 **Task Management:** requirements involving the management of tasks, whether handover

specific or generic to any clinical task management


 **Time Component:** these requirements involve explicit representation over time of the

information used in handover, such as in diary management, and handover snapshots


Page 13

HSCIC Controlled Document


 **Item Lists:** requirements dealing with the (conceptual) list of items, such as the ordering of

the items in a list or the inclusion criteria of the items in a list. For an illustration of the
difference between datasets and items, see Figure 4 below


 **Good Practice:** a catch-all category for requirements that do not readily fit into a user

interface-related category. The exclusion of requirements from this category does not mean
that they are not good practice, but that they fit better into another category


 **Encouragement/Discouragement:** several of the requirements may seem unusual in a set

of user requirements for a clinical system. This is because they fall between allowing users
to do something, and forcing them to do something. In as much as users should be
encouraged to do something, but they don’t have to. The reverse is also true for
discouragement


 **Updating:** requirements involving the update of information


 **Patient Identification:** requirements involving the identification of patients

##### **4.3.5 Datasets and Item Lists**


In order to illustrate the terms ’item’ and ’dataset’, and the categories named Dataset per Item and
Item List, Figure 4 below shows how they apply to a conceptual set of information that might be
used in handover.


**Notes**


 This illustration is not intended to show that handover information would be in a table format or that it
is only this summary data


 Requirements in the Datasets per Item category influence the attributes that go horizontally, and the
requirements in the Item List category influence the items that go vertically

### 5 NEXT STEPS FOR THE NHS CUI WORK ON HANDOVER


The aim of the handover investigation in Release 4 of the NHS CUI Design Guide was to create a
first draft of user requirements for handover, which could then be evaluated before any design work
or any design guidance is produced.


Having produced these requirements and the supporting documentation, the suggested next steps
listed below aim to evaluate the requirements in terms of accuracy and completeness.


 **Offer the existing requirements and supporting documentation out for consultation:**

the most effective consultation may require moderated feedback to gain a greater
illustration of the requirements


 **Illustrate the requirements ‘notionally’:** Henry Dowlen has put in place a framework for

notionally illustrating the requirement via a scenario that involves several different types of
handover. Notional illustration would help with the clarification of the existing requirements,
to communicate them for the purpose of evaluation, and to suggest new requirements.
Henry Dowlen would be a useful person to involve in this due to the time he has spent
being involved in handover IT support


 **Liaise with other groups who are investigating handover:** 0 lists other NHS-related

handover research projects that are known to the NHS CUI Team. In addition, there are the
clinical sites and companies working on handover solutions who were visited during this
work on handover. The intention for liaising with other groups should be to form/be a key
participant in a clinical handover community. Developing IT support for handover should
continue to involve more than just the consideration of the IT requirements. Further steps
should be taken to involve other medical stakeholders such as medical educators,
architects of clinical sites (for workplace design), rota policy makers (to ensure adequately
overlapping shifts) and so on


 **Investigate other existing clinical handover solutions:** this could involve a more

thorough analysis of the collected handover artefacts and a more in-depth evaluation of
existing handover solutions in-situ (for example, Henry Dowlen is developing a new system
at Charing Cross Hospital, which would be an interesting study site)


 **Investigate all types of handover:** although a variety of handover types were investigated,

not all types were. In addition, there was a emphasis towards hospital-based multi-patient
handover


 **Investigate handover in other industries:** much was learned by a visit to the National Air

Traffic Services to discover their experiences with and attitude to handover. Other
industries may be equally as valuable, especially if they use and/or have attempted to use
IT support for handover


 **Investigate other aims of handover:** in section 2, other aims of handover such as

education, team cohesion and error correction have been suggested. Their impact on the
existing requirements should be investigated


 **Consider how the clinical system functionality implied by the existing handover**

**requirements might be used for other clinical management purposes:** in observing
current clinical work in hospitals, the artefacts initially developed for handover (paper
patient lists) have become central to much of the clinical work done on wards. It is likely that
electronic versions would also have a similar impact.


 **Consider how the data generated by the system could be used for secondary**

**purposes.** Data captured could be used to:


 Form the basis for commissioning


 Support resource management


Page 15

HSCIC Controlled Document


 Facilitate audit


 **Gain a greater understanding of the IT environment that may exist to handover**

**support in the near future:** as well as understanding whether the assumptions about what
information will be available and to what degree, the likelihood of, and impact of, devices
such as tablet PCs and large-scale shared displays (interactive whiteboards) should be
considered


 **Evaluate existing clinical management systems** : for their effectiveness in supporting

handover (possibly using the existing requirements)


 **Think about how handover could be measured** : in order to help with evaluation of any

proposed/implemented handover solutions
