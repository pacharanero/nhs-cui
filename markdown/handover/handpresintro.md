# 2. Handover Definitions

  - _“The transfer of professional responsibility and accountability for some_
_or all aspects of care for a patient, or group of patients, to another_
_person or professional group on a temporary or permanent basis”_

(BMA Junior Doctors’ Committee and NPSA in Safe Handover: Safe Patients, 2004)

  - _“The goal of shift handover is the accurate, reliable communication of_
_task-relevant information across shift changes, thereby ensuring_
_continuity of safe and effective working”_

(Lardner in Health and Safety Executive report, 1996)

  - For the purposes of the NHS CUI programme, handover definition
includes the patient group, and the list of relevant tasks to facilitate a transfer of professional responsibility

# 3. Background

#### • The high level requirements were gathered from a number of visits across different locations and care areas. • There were 35 visits spanning across:

    - Primary Care (6)

    - Secondary Care (21)

    - Community Care (8)
#### • The following groups of people were interviewed:

    - Doctors (17)

    - Nurses (13)

    - AHPs (6)

    - IT (11)

    - Other (5) (for example, surgical service manager)

# 3. Background

#### Safety Critical

  - Handover is a common part of workflow in many industries, including
healthcare.

  - In industries other than healthcare, it has been found that adverse
events are more likely to occur a short time after shift handover has occurred.

  - Poor handover has been implicated as a contributing factor in several
large scale disasters.

  - Historically, the handover in a clinical context has often been thought of
as a process that occurs in Secondary Care at nursing shift change.

  - With the advent of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD) in
2003, junior doctors now have an explicit need for shift handover, and the desire to investigate and support handover has increased.

  - Support for handovers of any kind in a clinical context is rare, isolated,
experimental, and not integrated with a full electronic clinical management system.

# 3. Background

#### Wider Use

  - Handover has been identified as performing other functions aside from
transfer of information (for example, it is educational for those taking part)

  - Wears et al (2003) have identified handover as a point at which errors in
a system may be spotted and corrected, as staff ‘take stock’ of the situation.

  - By summarising current information in the presence of other staff,
handover can also be a point at which key decisions are made, and where a patient’s plan is formulated. Handover has also been seen to have a social function, particularly where team members handover together.

  - The NHS CUI work has focused primarily on how the information transfer
aspect of handover could be supported by IT.

# 4. Types of Handover

#### • Handovers can be categorised on many levels, with considerable overlap • The following list of handover categories is not exhaustive, neither are the categories mutually exclusive:

    - **Number of patients involved:** single patient / multiple patients

    - **Level of handover detail:** summary only / full detail

    - **Roles involved:** ward nurse, doctor, paramedic, district nurse,
physiotherapist and so on

# 4. Types of Handover

    - **Handover within or between roles:** within a role / between two
roles / multidisciplinary

    - **Care change:** type of care changes / type of care stays the same

    - **Scheduling:** ad-hoc / planned

    - **Synchronous:** staff handing over synchronously / asynchronously

    - **Face-to-face:** staff handing over face-to-face / not face-to-face

    - **Patient present:** yes / no

# 5. Users Involved in Handover

#### Interaction Between Users

  - There are at least two users or two sets of users.

  - An example of where the giver and receiver can both be sets of
individuals is ward nursing handovers where one team will go through their individual patients communally, and the other team will listen to and question the givers.

  - There may be users in handover who are involved on both sides of the
handover. For example, in shift handover, other staff that are on a different shift pattern may be present, and therefore they have worked on the shift now leaving, and will also be working with the new shift.

# 8. Category Sets

#### • The creation of the categories and the matching of requirements to the categories is subjective (and does not represent the only way of categorising the requirements) • The requirements are grouped into three main category sets:

    - Generic or Specific

    - Handover Stage

    - Handover Aspect

# 9. Next Steps

#### • Offer the existing requirements and supporting documentation out for consultation • Liaise with other groups who are investigating handover • Investigate:

    - Other existing clinical handover solutions

    - The requirements ‘notionally’

    - All types of handover

    - Handover in other industries

    - Other aims of handover

# 9. Next Steps

#### • Research secondary purposes

    - Consider how the data generated by the system could be used for
secondary purposes

    - Form the basis for commissioning

    - Support resource management

    - Facilitate audit

    - Gain a greater understanding of the IT environment that may exist
to handover support in the near future

    - Evaluate existing clinical management systems

    - Think about how handover could be measured
