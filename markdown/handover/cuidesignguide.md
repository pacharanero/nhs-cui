|33|Users can easily and quickly make<br>updates to information during handover<br>(including tasks). These updates are<br>reflected in the patient's record.|**Adopted**|Users need to be able to add tasks and change<br>information during the handover without overly<br>disrupting the handover. Any changes made to the<br>information must be part of the 'source' information<br>and not solely made on a 'handover copy' of it. If it<br>is too arduous to add a task at handover it may<br>lead users to resorting to paper notes.|<br>On-call is often the time when the most<br>difficult patients to handover are those that<br>are sick and have just arrived, and may not<br>be on the computer system/list.

A continually updated view may of<br>course be useful for things other than handover.<br>Some clinical areas require an ad-hoc handover<br>resource which is up-to-date all the time, current<br>examples include a shared whiteboard or an<br>annotated ward list.
